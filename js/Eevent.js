PAJCCI attributes this decline to restrictive SROs 1380(I)/2023, 1397(I)/2023 issued on October 3 and SROs 1402(1)/2023 October 7, 2023, inactive banking channels, and daily operational challenges at border crossings. \n\nTogether with the IDC, these obstacles are disrupting Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan and CIS countries, as well as the broader transit trade.\n\n“This 2% CESS, combined with existing economic pressures, is creating a perfect storm that could cripple Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan, CIS countries, and reverse cargo from Afghanistan,” stated President Junaid Makda of PAJCCI. “While PAJCCI firmly supports a documented economy, these measures are inadvertently pushing trade into informal, parallel channels. This not only harms our economy but also threatens Pakistan’s standing as a regional trade leader.”\n\nThe IDC has introduced a double-taxation burden on imports routed through KPK, requiring payments at both Karachi and Peshawar, creating a competitive disadvantage for KPK-based businesses. Inconsistent Cess policies across provinces further complicate the issue, with legal challenges in KPK and potential conflicts with International Agreements Afghanistan Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA). \n\nWhile Baluchistan’s exemption of Cess on exports is a positive step, the uneven regulatory environment is diverting trade away from KPK. Afghan traders are increasingly exploring alternative routes, including through Iran, due to additional costs at Torkham.\n\nIn response, PAJCCI has engaged Prime Minister’s Office, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), and key government stakeholders, including the senior representatives from the Ministry of Commerce (MoC), Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), as well as the Chief Minister and Governor of KPK. PAJCCI has consistently advocated for uniform policies aligned with federal guidelines to ensure a fair and stable trade environment. \n\n“We urge the government to implement an immediate and comprehensive action plan to remove barriers that hinder Pakistan’s export potential and regional trade leadership,” Makda added. “This requires not only addressing the IDC but also establishing consistent policies that support transparent, sustainable trade practices across Pakistan.”\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2024",

The country is also seeking to strengthen its relations with China, with discussions on bilateral relations and the implementation of the Doha Agreement. Meanwhile, there are calls for the complete implementation of the Doha Agreement, which is seen as crucial for Afghanistan's peace and stability. On the economic front, China has offered Afghanistan tariff-free trade, and the private sectors of Afghanistan and Kazakhstan have signed contracts worth $100 million. However, Pakistan has banned entry to parks and zoos due to worsening air pollution, which could affect regional cooperation. In the sports sector, Afghanistan's Gurbaz has guided the team to seal an ODI series over Bangladesh, while the world is watching as Trump and Putin speak, and Biden plans to lobby Trump to stick with Ukraine.",

"战乱、重建、困境、恢复……塔利班执政三年多，阿富汗社会环境也在改变。在阿富汗经营20多年的中国商人余明辉告诉观察者网，相比上次执政，塔利班成熟了许多，对基建、饥饿、毒品、人权等问题，也在下大力气整治。但在西方媒体的报道中，阿富汗却是另一幅景象。“他们总是会提，阿富汗在塔利班上台之前就陷入人道主义危机。但我们在阿富汗工人中做过详细调研，问他们老家有没有饿死人的，没有一个人说有。”但对于塔利班政府来说，重建面临的困难也是难以想象的。就在11月21日，中国驻阿富汗使馆还再次发布公告称，近期阿富汗多地发生安全事件，地震、洪涝等自然灾害频发多发，提醒中国公民近期暂勿前往阿富汗。谈及阿富汗重建工作，余明辉也告诉观察者网，塔利班比较缺乏搞经济建设的经验，他们特别想学习中国经验，只是还没有明白中国经验的内在逻辑，有点生搬硬套，不过随着越来越多中国企业的进入，中国的发展理念逐渐被带入阿富汗，未来也会有所改善。【对话/观察者网 郭涵】就业、基建、禁毒、妇女问题，塔利班这三年来做了什么观察者网：从2021年8月上台至今3年多以来，塔利班在阿富汗的执政给您留下最深刻的印象是什么？余明辉：我认为最大的变化就是阿塔作为执政党，更成熟了。2021年夺取政权时，他们吸取了之前的教训，姿态放得比较低。我还记得2021年8月15日那一天，塔利班进入喀布尔，重新掌控了阿富汗整个国家。当时我们在中国城，非常担心失去秩序后有流民抢劫。但塔利班实际进城只用了一天，而且到处张贴安民告示，过程也没有太大的波澜。塔利班新上任的警察局长还派周边街区的人过来，问我们有什么安全方面的需求，如果需要派兵保卫的话也没问题，提出可以把哨所设在中国城对面。他们当时强调最多的一点就是，我们不会骚扰你们、不会蹭你们的饭（他们中午都是吃自己带的馕），不会像原政权的警察那样办什么事都要收钱。后来，塔利班内政部给我们办了一份安全保障的文件，证明我们在这里经营多年，不允许任何其它的部门来骚扰，基本上就是这个情况。2024年8月14日拍摄的阿富汗首都喀布尔。新华社我个人认为，塔利班付出了很大努力想证明，他们和被推翻的那个民选政府有很大不同。他们想强调自身不会贪腐，而且也想做成事。比如塔利班刚上台时，阿富汗驻华大使馆和喀布尔断了联系。我们国内有两位某研究院的研究员希望去阿富汗及时开展调研，但是办不了签证，于是托我们去联系塔利班政府里的人，然后很快做了特殊安排。英国BBC还报道了这件事，说中国的几家企业可以拿特殊签证进阿富汗。还有一个对比是，8年前我们想找原阿富汗政府申请一个钢厂的二期建设审批，但是政府审批的进度很慢，一年办一点手续、推进得很慢，每当有政府部门更换部长时就卡我们。这事一直拖到塔利班上台后，我们去找新的土地部长，用了一年时间就由经济委员会给批下来了。观察者网：塔利班今年8月份公布了执政成绩，过去一年来在全国启动了400多项工程，提供了超过1.5万个就业岗位，并对喀布尔的国际机场进行翻修。能否聊聊塔利班政府在基础设施建设方面的一手观察？余明辉：首先，对于这些公开的政绩，实际情况你大致可以打一个对折。我是这样看的，在中东一些地方搞基建，按照他们自身的起点和标准来说，这确实算是很不错的成绩。但是以我们中国人的基建效率来看，这不算什么，深圳当年的“一天一层楼”，那才是中国人习惯的效率。客观地说，阿富汗这边开展基建的进度相当缓慢，但这不仅仅是阿富汗，而是包括中亚五国、伊朗、阿联酋等国家的普遍情况。塔利班正在做一些修路架桥的工作，因为过去基本上是“百废待兴”的状态。他们说启动了工程，但没有明确说这些工程什么时候完工，对吧？我们最近去乌兹别克斯坦驻喀布尔的大使馆交流，使馆门口的整个一条街都被挖开，在修下水道，打算铺上柏油路。柏油路在喀布尔还算比较普遍，但这里85%以上的地区是没有下水道的。我在使馆的交流会上，和一个之前在城建部门工作的阿富汗人聊天，说到修路的情况，他说现在每天要很早起床工作，晚上还要加班，可没有过去那么闲了。观察者网：您2022年初曾在观察者网撰文，谈到了在政权更替时期，美国依然冻结原阿富汗政府主权资产，外界广泛担忧阿富汗饥荒问题将会严重恶化。这个问题后续情况如何？余明辉：这也算是外国媒体最关心的话题了。他们总是会提，阿富汗在塔利班上台之前就陷入人道主义危机，50%甚至更多的人口面临饥荒或者营养不良之类。我不能代表别人，但是我们在喀布尔中国城以及合作工厂里的几百名阿富汗工人中做过详细调研，问他们（不同省份的）老家有没有饿死人的，没有一个人说有。但是，有些地方有人吸大烟，吸得迷糊了最后冻死，这种情况是存在的，虽然并不多。我们也亲自去过一些矿山所在的山村探访，哪怕是最贫穷的家庭里面也有一些土豆和馕，他们可能吃不上肉，但是基本口粮还是有的。阿富汗村庄里正在享用晚餐的一家人。网络我从塔利班上台之前就开始观察，这四五年间，我认为一些联合国机构在当地统计的数字并不完全准确。这些机构在国际上都比较权威、知名度很高，也在阿富汗设置了项目部，从事各种各样的业务。我观察，大部分联合国工作人员是清廉的，但是对阿富汗具体情况掌握的不够充分。因为他们在这里摸底，主要还是依靠阿富汗本地人去做调查、探访和收集信息。由于这些数据决定了联合国、国际社会对阿富汗的援助力度，所以，阿富汗人确实存在通过夸大灾情，包括贫困和饥荒的数字，进而争取到更多国际援助的这样一种心理。如果不是亲自去到阿富汗，或者是和当地人打交道时间比较短，确实很难了解到真实的情况。观察者网：塔利班上台后推进的禁毒政策也引发了外界关注，成效如何？余明辉：简单来说，塔利班刚上台的时候，也就是从2021年8月到2022年8月这第一年，花了大力气把禁毒当作一项标志性政绩，包括建立了一些禁毒院。我们以前在喀布尔各个街区都能看到三五成群的吸毒者，把被子蒙在头上，警察都管不了。但是塔利班上台以后，把这些吸毒贩毒的人几乎全都肃清了。这也应了我前面说的，塔利班二次上台后确实比他们第一次上台执政时更加成熟，开始注重国际形象，禁毒这件事就很好地树立了一种形象。当然，随着塔利班开始把工作重心转向经济建设、发展同周边和其它国家贸易上面，到了执政第三年，零星的贩毒吸毒活动又有点死灰复燃的迹象，但是没有前一任政府时期那么明目张胆。至于以后会不会又蔓延，谁也不好讲。观察者网：塔利班政府成员的宗教背景，是否会和追求世俗化的治理与发展目标产生矛盾？最近也有所谓“塔利班禁止女性在公共场合说话”的新闻登上热搜，您能向国内读者介绍一下实际情况吗？余明辉：你刚才说的那个报道是不实消息。塔利班政府在今年8月通过了一个《道德法》，并且把原来政府的“妇女权益保障部”改成了“劝善惩恶部”，负责执行那部法律。至于说女性在公共场合不能说话，这是不存在的。哪怕只是一位埃米尔看似提出了这样的想法，也不可能做到。这部法律颁布到现在几个月了，我们从来没有看见有人因为犯了这一条被抓的。塔利班对妇女权利的限制是不是非常严重？是。有没有像国内部分媒体（他们跟西方媒体一个口径）描绘的那样变成“人间地狱”？没有。现在我们都能在街上看到买菜、去商场购物的阿富汗妇女，她们一样能讲话，当然她们的衣着相比以前更加趋于保守。阿富汗喀布尔街头的行人。视频截图我问过一些塔利班官员这个话题，他们给我的解释，不管是否让人信服，就是阿富汗对妇女形象的看法应该是比较高贵。如果她们在公共场合大声喧嚣、与人产生争执，不利于维持妇女的端庄形象。中国企业投资阿富汗，一定要做好前期调研观察者网：除了主权资产在美国被冻结，塔利班政府也面临着无法获得国际承认的困境。这对经济有哪些影响，塔利班政府是否有可能采取行动改善困境？余明辉：短期内走出这个困境还是比较难。原因有三个方面：首先，塔利班这边有非常多的人权问题不良纪录，这是难以抹清的；第二，目前阿富汗问题不是国际关注的焦点，俄乌冲突、加沙冲突才是现在的焦点。就算塔利班希望向美国等西方国家让步，达成妥协，那些国家暂时也没有精力操心这件事；最后，可以明显感知到联合国在阿富汗的作用在下降，多年以来设置的交流和沟通机制，目前都无法起到比较大的作用。观察者网：能否从一名华商的个人角度，聊聊您对塔利班政府在招商引资问题上的观察？余明辉：打个比方，比如你要用手推一辆汽车，如果你知道从正确的地方发力，那么只需要8成力道就能推动汽车前进。用的力道不对，再怎么使劲都是白忙活。我认为如果塔利班把精力集中在正确的地方，方法得当，阿富汗会迎来非常快的发展，但至少到目前，我们还没有观察到这样的现象发生。塔利班当然在用力推，但是比较缺乏搞经济建设的经验，在很多地方白白消耗精力，导致无法全力推动经济发展。这也是我们在不同场合同塔利班政府代表对话时一直讲的，可以向中国学习的原因之一。举个例子，不只是塔利班，许多伊斯兰国家的政府手上有资金时最喜欢做一件事，就是建设漂亮的城市。因为这是立竿见影的成绩，老百姓马上就能看见。在中东那些搞现代化落后了差不多几百年的国家，现代化在他们眼中就意味着高楼大厦，这是让老百姓感受最直观，帮助他们建立对政权合法性认同的最有说服力的方式。但是我在交流中跟他们说，你们看北京、上海、深圳和广州这些城市灯火辉煌、到处是高楼大厦，在表面的背后，中国政府付出了很大的心血。中国上世纪80年代搞改革开放的时候也有将近10亿人口，这个庞大基数承担了试错的成本，阿富汗能承担试错的成本吗？中国的基建行业也是一步步发展起来的，到现在不管是质量、成本还是效率都是世界第一，但这不是一天就能实现的。同样一件东西，如果今天中国来做是一件完美的成品，但阿富汗按同样的方式做可能就是个次品。他们政府里的人听了也哈哈大笑，说确实是这样，所以要向中国学习，包括搞工业建设、经济发展都是同样的逻辑。他们想学中国的现成经验，但是不能生搬硬套。如果你说现在要学习西班牙，学美国、英国还是伊朗，可能都不适合阿富汗的国情。当地时间9月3日，安全人员在喀布尔街头检查过往车辆。新华社当然，我前面说的也不代表塔利班政府想要搞“面子工程”，因为这个词包含的前提是你的民生建设已经饱和了，再搞工程也不会带来实际效益。但是，阿富汗国内现在很多基础的房屋建设条件还很差，甚至政府办公楼的楼梯都不平整，要错开上下行。保守地说，阿富汗至少10年内都不存在真正意义上的“面子工程”。观察者网：对于有意愿投资阿富汗的中国企业，您有没有什么建议？对于塔利班政府改善营商环境的努力，您有哪些具体的建议或期待？余明辉：我印象特别深的是，外交部亚洲司刘劲松司长曾经对中企投资阿富汗提过一个建议。因为刘司长曾在阿富汗做过大使，为两国之间的交往做了很多工作，包括开通“松子空中走廊”，协助对阿富汗青少年先天病的治疗等等。他说企业一定要做好前期的可行性调研。比如你一个亿的项目，可能就要花5%甚至到10%的调研费。如果是两三百万的项目，也要有二三十万的调研费。这个基础工作做不好，就很容易吃亏。很多企业看到了塔利班欢迎投资，中国政府也不反对，但一方面那些是政治层面的表态，在商务层面是来不得半点马虎的，每一个产品或市场，每一个客户都要靠谈判来确定，这是非常专业的过程。最近一年来，上百家企业来阿富汗进行咨询调研，我也跟他们说这个问题。最后能落地的很少，这里面有企业的问题，也有塔利班政府的问题。一是部分中国企业还是抱有侥幸心理，觉得他可以是例外，运气会很好。但例外是不存在的，一定要谨慎调研。另一方面，我们对塔利班的建议也是，要尊重以互惠互利为基础的商业法则。塔利班政府里有部分人存在不切实际的认识：他们觉得自己打了40多年的仗，落得如此贫穷的地步，是国际社会欠他们的，国际社会就应该向他们提供援助。除了联合国与主权国家的官方援助外，也有国企、私企的投资是要追求利润回报的。也许一笔战略投资无法在一年两年内盈利，但是人家都会有商业计划书，是一定要按着那些方案推进的。对于这些商业计划书、商业合同，应该有清晰的法律法规来确保执行，保护外国人和外国投资的权益。这是主权国家间开展商业活动、处理纠纷时的自然道理。现在塔利班张开双臂欢迎周边国家投资，对来自中国的投资抱有的期望最大。但请客吃饭不仅仅是把人请到家里招待，而是要有清晰的投资法与相关保障机制。对于完善法律法规、法治和制度建设这方面的薄弱，塔利班其实是还没有充分意识到。我们跟一些塔利班官员提到这些建议，他们每个人都同意，觉得很有道理，但是每一个单独的官员都无法当家，也就是推动制定一套完善的法律法规体制。确实有不少中国企业在这方面吃亏，我们也觉得很惋惜。有些企业进入阿富汗的时间只有三五年，最多六七年，他们仅仅看到了表面，还没有看到更深层的原因。有些企业认为塔利班对投资很热情，很客气，有阿富汗人骗了中企的钱，塔利班的警察马上把那些人抓起来打一顿，等等。但商业投资的逻辑比这些表象更深。",

This lack of recognition hinders economic development and limits Afghanistan's potential as a regional corridor. Regional countries are taking steps to mitigate security challenges, with over a dozen countries maintaining diplomatic missions in Kabul. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, which recognized the Taliban in the 1990s, are currently unlikely to do so again due to ongoing security concerns. China, however, has taken a bold step by accepting the credentials of the Taliban's envoy to Beijing, reflecting its strategic interests in maintaining stability in the region and preventing terrorism. China's engagement with the Taliban includes providing humanitarian aid and supporting reconstruction efforts, while emphasizing the need for a moderate and inclusive government. The issue of women's rights, while important, is not considered a top priority by China, which focuses more on addressing poverty, hunger, refugees, and terrorism threats.",
                                    "content": "Almost three and a half years have passed since the Taliban took over Kabul, yet no country has formally recognised their government.\n\nThis status quo is hampering much-needed economic development in the war-torn country. At the same time, it is limiting Afghanistan’s potential to serve as a lucrative corridor for the region and beyond. \n\nFor several reasons, this uncertainty is neither in Kabul’s interest nor a good sign for the world at large. Yet, the United States and other NATO members seem less concerned. The regional countries, however, are taking calculated steps to mitigate the security challenges posed by this volatile atmosphere. \n\nBy offering carrots, they are making efforts to convince Kabul that changing course would be beneficial to all. The diplomatic presence of over a dozen neighbouring countries in Afghanistan is a clear reflection of this stance. \n\nAzerbaijan, China, Iran, Kazakhstan, Türkiye, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Russia, and Uzbekistan have already opened their missions, while Indian diplomats are also serving in Kabul. At the same time, several European countries are also weighing this option. The Taliban know that they have a much better bargaining position than ever. \n\n\"Opening embassies is a decision of the countries themselves. Afghanistan does not beg anyone in this matter. If they want their embassy to be active, Afghanistan has no obstacles and security is ensured. Currently, we have embassies from more than sixteen countries in Kabul, all of them are active and have no problems,\" remarked Islamic Emirate’s spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid recently. \n\nThe question is, who will take the lead in recognising the Taliban, and what minimal steps must Kabul take to end the stalemate? \n\nPakistan, Saudi Arabia, and UAE \n\nBack in the 1990s, only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates recognised the Islamic Emirate as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan. \n\nThose were different times. Despite repatriating 0.75 million refugees, Pakistan is still home to 4.4 million Afghans. Yet, it faces ‘unprovoked border firing’ and other acts of aggression that claim innocent lives. \n\nHence, it seems practically impossible for Pakistan to recognise the Taliban government at present. There is also no sign that Abu Dhabi or Riyadh is interested in being the first to do so. \n\nThis is despite the recent meeting between Saudi Ambassador to Afghanistan Faisal Bin Talaq Al-Baqmi and Afghan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul. \n\nDuring the talks, Muttaqi expressed hope that bilateral relations would be further enhanced. However, Al-Baqmi responded cautiously, stressing \"pragmatic steps towards further developing relations with Afghans.\" \n\nSimilarly, Mawlawi Badreddin Haqqani presented his credentials to UAE’s Deputy Chief Protocol Affairs Saif Abdullah Al Shamsi. However, the appointment of the new ambassador has yet to yield significant results. \n\nBadreddin is awaiting a date to present his credentials to the ruler of the United Arab Emirates. \n\nBadreddin Haqqani is not related to Sirajuddin Haqqani, one of the most powerful Taliban leaders and the current interior minister. He had earlier served in a similar position in the UAE. \n\nChina’s bold step\n\nNevertheless, Chinese President Xi Jinping, despite his security concerns, has taken a bold step in formally accepting the credentials of the Taliban’s envoy to Beijing. Since then, Asadullah Bilal Karimi has been serving in China as a symbol of realpolitik. \n\nCan China go a step further and formally recognise the Taliban? \n\nBefore answering this question, it is important to analyse why China has gone the extra mile to please the Taliban. \n\nBeijing has successfully achieved its strategic objective by delivering a blow to the separatist movement in Xinjiang. It least wants the infiltration of terrorists from Afghanistan into its region, which borders eight countries. \n\nChina is aware that post-US withdrawal, Afghanistan poses a bigger threat than at any point in recent history. In an interview, China’s special envoy for Afghanistan stressed that after 20 years of US occupation, more than 20 terrorist groups existed, while there were only one or two when NATO intervened in Afghanistan.\n\nSimilar reservations were expressed in Samarkand during the fourth meeting of Foreign Ministers of Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan, a unique initiative launched by Pakistan on September 8, 2021. \n\nEarlier, the foreign ministers of China, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan met in Islamabad, Tehran, and Tunxi to address the Afghan quagmire. \n\nHowever, the Samarkand declaration \"pointed out that all terrorist groups, namely the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Al-Qaeda, the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Jundallah, Jaish-al-Adl, Jamaat Ansarullah, and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), and other terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan continue to pose a serious threat to regional and global security.\" \n\n\"Terrorism is a primary concern for all parties. This is why China is actively participating in supporting all parties in peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan, mobilising assistance from regional and international communities, and cooperating with Afghanistan to achieve shared goals, including combating terrorism and ensuring security,\" Yue Xiaoyong explained China's stance. \n\nHence, intense engagement is key to securing border areas. \n\nSince the Taliban took over Kabul, Beijing has also provided them with $64 million in humanitarian aid and a helping hand in reconstruction. It is equally pressing for a moderate and inclusive government. \n\nYue Xiaoyong said, \"China supports achieving peace... This includes building a national political framework, forming a moderate and inclusive government, continuing humanitarian and developmental aid, enhancing security—especially cybersecurity—and working together for shared development.\" \n\nUnlike the United States and some other Western countries, China does not consider women's issues a top priority. \n\n\"The issue of women, which you mentioned, is an important topic and has received widespread attention. However, it is neither the entirety of Afghanistan’s problems nor the main or root cause. We must continue to prioritise Afghan women while also collaborating with the global community to tackle Afghanistan’s most pressing challenges, such as poverty, hunger, refugees, and terrorism threats,\" replied a Chinese diplomat to a question. \n\nAmbassador Yue had recently traveled to Pakistan as well. He held talks with Foreign Secretary Amina Baloch and Additional Secretary Ahmad Naseem Warraich. No concrete declaration was issued, but it was stressed that \"Both sides exchanged views on relations with Afghanistan and affirmed the vital role of neighboring countries for a peaceful and stable Afghanistan.\"\n\nTo be continued...",

                                    "abstract": "Iran's stance on recognizing the Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan is influenced by several factors, including security threats, cultural concerns, and economic interests. The country has faced multiple terrorist attacks, including a recent suicide bombing at the tomb of General Qassem Soleimani, which killed 91 people and injured 284. These attacks, attributed to Daesh-Khorasan Province, highlight the security risks posed by militants crossing the Afghan-Iran border. Additionally, Iran is concerned about the marginalization of Persian culture and language in Afghanistan, as well as border clashes. Despite these challenges, there have been positive developments in Afghan-Iran relations, such as the resolution of disputes over the Helmand River and a significant increase in trade. However, Iran is unlikely to recognize the Taliban without regional or international support. The role of the United States, under a potential Trump administration, could be crucial in this regard. The Taliban's stance on women's rights and their rejection of external demands also complicate the situation. Recognizing the Taliban could offer a pathway to regional security and unlock Afghanistan's economic potential, but it would require guarantees from the Taliban that they will not allow attacks on other countries from their territory.",
                                    "content": "Tehran has cultivated good relations with successive governments as well as almost all major warring factions in Afghanistan. However, due to multiple factors, taking the lead in recognising the Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan seems impossible for Iran. \n\nOne of the most important factors is the security threat posed by terrorists who infiltrate from Afghan-Iran border areas or incite extremists in other countries to attack Iran. \n\nThe suicide attack at the tomb of US-assassinated Iranian General Qassem Soleimani is a stark reminder of how Daesh-Khorasan Province (KP) can unleash terror in Iran. The attack on January 3, 2024, struck in Kerman when thousands of devotees were gathered to observe the fourth anniversary of the martyrdom of the Al-Quds Force commander Soleimani.\n\nThe attack left 91 people martyred and 284 injured, including women and children. Iran's Ministry of Intelligence claimed one of the terrorists was a Tajik national.\n\nEarlier, Daesh-KP had targeted the sacred Shah-e-Cheragh Shrine twice, martyring 15 people martyred and wounding 43. The shrine complex in Shiraz houses the tombs of Ahmad and Muhammad, sons of Imam Musa al-Kazim and brothers of Imam Ali Reza. The attackers in both incidents were Daesh-KP-linked terrorists from Tajikistan.\n\nThe Daesh has also attacked Iran’s parliament and the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.\n\nHowever, it is alarming that Daesh-KP opted to use Tajik militants not only in Moscow but also in Kerman and Shiraz.\n\nUnlike Russia, Iran is home to the largest population of Afghan migrants. Since the Taliban takeover of Kabul, the number of refugees has exceeded six million (7% of Iran’s total population), including a significant number of Tajiks.\n\nFor Iran, terrorism is not the only reason to be alarmed about Afghanistan becoming a hotbed of militants.\n\nThe transformation of Afghanistan into a purely Pashtun identity is another eye-opener for Tehran. Historically, a large part of present-day Afghanistan was once ruled by Persia. Consequently, both Pashto and Persian are official languages.\n\nAccording to Britannica, \"More than a fifth of the population speaks Pashto, the language of Pashtuns, while about half speak some dialect of Persian.\"\n\nAttempts to marginalise the Persian language equate to erasing Persian culture and traditions that have prevailed across Afghanistan for centuries.\n\nBorder clashes are another issue.\n\nThe United Nations has documented at least 80 border incidents: 59 on the Afghan-Pakistan border, 16 on the Afghan-Iranian border, three on the Afghan-Tajik border, and one on the Afghan-Uzbek border.\n\nNevertheless, there has been some positive developments in Afghan-Iran relations. Both countries have amicably resolved disputes over the transboundary Helmand River.\n\nMost importantly, the official trade volume between the two countries has exceeded $4 billion annually. Afghanistan exports minerals, raisins, sesame, and other materials, while importing petroleum products, cement, and other raw materials.\n\nAccording to the spokesman for Afghanistan’s Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Akhundzada Abul Salam Jawad, \"Trade between Afghanistan and Iran in the first nine months of 2024 amounted to $2.194 billion, with $38 million in exports and $2.156 billion in imports.\"\n\nCould this trade justify recognising the Taliban as Afghanistan’s legitimate rulers? \n\nIndications are that Tehran would avoid being labelled part of \"rogue regimes\" unless regional powers or the international community take the lead.\n\nWhat role will Trump-led US admin play?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump once considered courting the Taliban leadership at Camp David. However, he called off those peace talks after a US soldier was among 12 killed in a car explosion.\n\nSince that September 2019 incident, both the Taliban and the Washington have engaged extensively. The Doha Accord and the subsequent withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan underscore these engagements.\n\nFrom invasion to withdrawal, the US kept shifting its goals. However, on August 16, 2021, President Biden articulated a policy statement that could lay the foundation for Taliban recognition. \n\n\"Our mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation-building. It was never supposed to be creating a unified, centralised democracy. Our only vital national interest in Afghanistan remains today what it has always been: preventing a terrorist attack on American soil.\"\n\nSince the Taliban took over Kabul, no major terrorist incident has occurred on American soil. Yet, as Pakistani diplomat Asif Durrani suggests, such incidents may recur if militancy in Afghanistan remains unchecked. \n\nWill President-elect Trump risk such an outcome or encourage the Taliban to engage in constructive dialogue to ensure regional and global security?\n\nHe must consider that if the United States does not lead in recognising the Taliban, regional countries may embrace them out of necessity, given their compromised security.\n\nUnited Nations expresses dismay\n\nThe United Nations has expressed dismay over restrictions on women and girls in Afghanistan. However, the Taliban remain steadfast in rejecting external demands. \n\nThe Taliban argue that mutual interests should take precedence over external criticism of their governance system.\n\nAfghan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Muttaqi has stated: \"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan respects the interests, choices, governance structures, and development models of others. In turn, it expects others to respect Afghanistan’s interests, governance, and development choices.\"\n\nIsolating the Taliban benefits neither the region nor the world. The US has neither the will nor the justification to topple the Taliban regime, given the lack of a viable alternative to govern Afghanistan. \n\nRecognition might offer a pathway forward, obliging the Taliban to ensure regional security. It could also unlock Afghanistan’s potential as an economic corridor.\n\nFor such a bargain, the Taliban must guarantee that no one operating from Afghanistan \"on their behalf\" or independently will attack another homeland.\n\nThe author is Controller News at Geo News.

Over the past 75 years, China's relations with Bulgaria, Romania, and Albania have withstood the test of international changes, with deepening political trust, expanding practical cooperation, and the development of a special friendship between the peoples. The friendship between China and these three countries has grown stronger and more fruitful, and it is now thriving in the new era.",

                                    "content": "Since the October 7th massacre in southern Israel and the outbreak of the war in Gaza, China’s leadership has conveyed outright support in word and deed for the Iran-led “Axis of Resistance.” The display of strategic vulnerability by Iran and its proxies since mid-August appears to have prompted Beijing to pause and reassess. Upon return from the National Day holiday in early October, China’s official messaging on Iran noticeably shifted. This adjustment has been further underscored by commentary from Chinese policy advisers specializing in the Middle East. As events on the ground led to a review of its Middle East policies, China is refraining from outright public support of Iran and the Axis of Resistance it leads, at least for the time being. This is borne out by the striking difference between China’s response to Iran’s missile and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attack on Israel in mid-April and its reaction to the latest ballistic missile attack on Israel by Iran on October 1. Similarly, the Chinese response to Israel’s retaliatory strike on Iran on October 28 reflected this revised approach. While the Foreign Ministry refrained from condemning Israel per se for its most recent attack, one of China’s most respected Middle East policy advisers all but justified it in an op-ed published in the China Daily. A Tale of Two Telephone Calls The day after the first Iranian drone and missile attack on Israel, on April 15, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a phone call with his then-Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and showcased China’s steadfast support to Iran. The Chinese Foreign Ministry’s official readout quoted Wang as all but endorsing Iran’s barrage of drones and missiles on Israel: China has noted that Iran stated that the actions taken by Iran were limited and that it was exercising its right to self-defense ... China appreciates Iran's emphasis on not targeting regional countries and neighboring countries, and reaffirming its continued pursuit of a policy of good-neighborliness and friendship. China believes that Iran can handle the situation well and avoid further destabilization while safeguarding Iran's sovereignty and dignity. Less than six months later, Beijing changed its stance. In the midst of the Chinese national holiday, on October 2, in response to Iran’s mass missile attack on Israel, the Foreign Ministry’s spokesperson in response simply stated that “China is deeply concerned about the turbulence in the Middle East.” Following mounting international reports regarding potential Israeli retaliatory operations against Iran, on October 9, the Chinese ministry’s spokesperson reiterated the “deep concerns” over the instability in the Middle East and the need to prevent escalation. At the daily briefing, a reporter’s pointed question, which included extreme scenarios of Israeli attacks on Iran’s strategic sites and anticipated harsh criticism of Israel, resulted only in a measured expression of concern. The spokesperson merely called on all parties to “manage the current situation in a calm, rational and responsible manner from the perspective of preserving regional peace and stability.” This response amounts to China diplomatically distancing itself from Iran. Five days later, on October 14, Wang called up his new Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi. This time around, the official Chinese readout of the call conspicuously avoided any possible hint or suggestion that China approves of Iran’s missile attacks. While the readout commended Tehran’s diplomatic outreach to Arab countries, it implied subtle criticism noting that China “opposed taking adventurous military actions and called on all parties to do more to maintain regional peace and stability.” Beijing’s readout even seemed to present Iran as apologetic, stating that the Iranian minister promised to strengthen communication and coordination with China to “cool down” the regional situation. Rather than demonstrating close China-Iran relations, the call reinforced Beijing’s new “even-handed” approach toward Iran. China’s Tempered Stance Toward Israel The distancing of Iran was reinforced by the parallel toning down of Chinese animosity toward Israel, which had become rife since the October 7 massacre. The linkage between the diplomatic distancing of Iran and toning down criticism toward Israel was demonstrated on the day China’s foreign minister spoke with his Iranian counterpart – a conversation that came after a call between Wang and Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz. The most striking example of this rhetorical adjustment is the formal statement by Lin Jian, the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s spokesperson, following Israel’s retaliatory strike on Iran on October 26. In the daily briefing of October 28, Lin sidestepped a leading question asked by a reporter from Russia’s TASS that anticipated condemning Israel. The reporter alleged the Israeli attack led to “exacerbating the escalation of the conflict and endangering civilians.” Instead, Lin noted that China “opposes infringing upon the sovereignty and security of other countries and opposes resorting to the use of force,” and called on “all parties concerned' to “avoid further raising the overall security risks.” Despite official condemnations of Israel from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the spokesperson refrained from even the slightest condemnation. The Chinese envoy to the United Nations, however, was critical of Israel even though he refrained from specifically and straightforwardly expressing condemnation. Rather, he stated that “China condemns acts that violate Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity…” Despite his harsh criticism of Israel during the U.N. Security Council hearing convened on October 28, his careful wording spoke volumes. Chinese Policy Advisers Rethink Iran This shift in China’s official public messaging regarding Iran aligns with public commentary by Chinese policy advisers specializing in the Middle East. Professor Liu Zhongmin, head of the well-respected Middle East Studies Institute at Shanghai International Studies University, asserted that “the Axis of Resistance led by Iran has suffered significant losses and even a complete failure. The export of the revolution by Iran and ideological diplomacy has reached an unsustainable dead end.” In a subsequent piece, Liu argued that Iran and its proxies have harmed the Palestinian cause. Similarly, a researcher from the think tank affiliated with China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the China Institute of International Studies, commented on Iran’s nuclear policy. Responding to a statement from an Iranian lawmaker that Iran is considering withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Li Zixin warned that such a move would constitute crossing a red line that goes against Iran’s own interests. Notably, any change in China’s public stance on Iran is likely to be limited, at least in the near term. This is not the first time that China has distanced itself from Iran, as it repeatedly sided with the UAE over a bilateral border dispute. Furthermore, a recent study by a Chinese policy adviser contended that the Chinese-Iranian bilateral relationship is held back by “little political mutual trust” and that Beijing is less keen on deepening the relationship than Tehran. Notwithstanding, China has other strategic considerations involving Iran, particularly in Afghanistan, a neighbor of both countries and where Iran holds influence, and in the broader context of China’s partnership with Russia, to which Iran contributes militarily. Is China Recalibrating Its Middle East Ambitions? The current dynamics – marked by Iranian setbacks and strategic vulnerability – have challenged China’s Middle East strategy since October 7. Beijing’s steadfast support to Tehran was based on the assessment that Iran and its proxies could advance China’s interests and influence in the region by thwarting the Saudi-Israeli normalization. Furthermore, Chinese policy advisers were confident that Beijing was on the way to assuming a key role in “Middle East Security Governance,” as extensively outlined in a paper published by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Following Beijing’s role in the 2023 Saudi-Iran agreement, Chinese leaders and diplomats considered the Middle East as a key arena for validating one of their key initiatives – the Global Security Initiative (GSI). Understanding it cannot rely on Iran to advance its strategic interests in the Middle East has had a broader impact on China’s approach to the Middle East, even beyond adjusting its rhetoric on Israel. Considering recent Chinese expert commentary that noted the limits on China’s influence in the Middle East, this experience may have somewhat curbed Beijing’s strategic ambitions in the region, including applying the GSI in the Middle East. Thus, Beijing’s shifting position toward Tehran and its Axis of Resistance might well evolve into a strategic turning point in China’s Middle East policy.",

He also pointed out that the changing global dynamics and the challenges faced by both countries from the West make it imperative for India and China to seek engagement rather than isolation. Kulkarni noted that the Indian society is becoming more supportive of improving relations with China, and that the fertile ground for such a relationship has been established. He criticized the Western attempts to use India to counterbalance China, suggesting that the best way to thwart such designs is to improve bilateral relations.

Jaishankar expressed India's willingness to use the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations as an opportunity to advance Sino-Indian relations. He acknowledged that both countries play important roles in international affairs, reflecting the potential for Sino-Indian cooperation. India also opposes unilateralism, does not support military alliances, and advocates for the democratization of international relations, willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with China in multilateral mechanisms such as the G20 and BRICS. The meeting between Xi Jinping and Modi on October 23, 2024, during the BRICS summit in Kazan was the first in five years, and it was seen as a sign of Sino-Indian relations moving out of a low point. During the meeting, both sides agreed to strengthen communication and cooperation, enhance strategic trust, and have their foreign ministers and officials at all levels engage in dialogue to return Sino-Indian relations to a stable development track. On the long-standing border issue, the Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed on October 31 that a solution had been reached, and frontline troops were implementing it.",

Both sides should respect each other's core interests, enhance mutual trust through dialogue and communication, and handle differences with sincerity and integrity to push the two countries' relations back to a stable and healthy development track as soon as possible.

Both China and India adhere to a non-aligned foreign policy, uphold multilateralism, and support the democratization of international relations.

Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi recently met on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Their discussions, which focused on the next steps for bilateral ties, came just a month after India and China reached a historic agreement to disengage at two key friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The meeting highlighted the progress made in the de-escalation of tensions at the Depsang Plains and Demchok—two of the most contentious areas along the LAC. Both countries had agreed to implement new patrolling arrangements on October 21, marking an important step in stabilizing the border. According to Jaishankar, this disengagement process, which includes de-escalation and de-induction of troops, is moving forward as planned. Jaishankar emphasized that the diplomatic understanding reached in Kazan (Russia) during a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping had been effectively implemented on the ground. “I am glad to note that the implementation of that understanding has proceeded as planned,” Jaishankar said. The discussions between the two foreign ministers covered a range of bilateral and global issues. One of the key outcomes was a shared commitment to enhancing cooperation on several fronts, including: The two ministers also discussed the evolving global situation and international issues. Jaishankar underscored India’s commitment to a multipolar world, emphasizing that India’s foreign policy is based on independent thought and action. He reaffirmed that India does not view its relationships through the lens of other countries, prioritizing its national interests and sovereignty. Jaishankar and Wang agreed that India-China relations are increasingly important in the context of global geopolitics. Both countries have cooperated effectively within multilateral frameworks such as BRICS, SCO, and the G20. Despite ongoing differences, their shared interests in regional stability and economic growth provide a strong foundation for further collaboration. Looking ahead, Jaishankar and Wang confirmed that discussions would continue with meetings of the Special Representatives and the Foreign Secretary-Vice Minister mechanisms taking place soon. These diplomatic engagements are designed to build on the progress made and address any remaining issues in the bilateral relationship. The ongoing dialogue between India and China marks a critical phase in their efforts to stabilize and strengthen bilateral ties. By focusing on cooperation and mutual interests while managing differences, both nations are laying the groundwork for a more peaceful and productive future. The successful disengagement along the LAC and the upcoming diplomatic meetings offer hope for continued progress in their complex relationship.",

                                    "content": "JakartaBaru-baru ini, Presiden Prabowo Subianto berada di London, Inggris. Dia juga sudah mengunjungi Uni Emirat Arab. Selama hampir dua minggu, Prabowo yang menjabat sejak Oktober, telah sangat aktif menjalankan misi diplomatik hampir di seluruh dunia.Di Beijing, Cina, ia bertemu dengan Presiden Cina Xi Jinping, kemudian mengadakan pembicaraan dengan Presiden AS Joe Biden di Washington. Sebelumnya, dia berbicara lewat telepon dengan presiden terpilih, Donald Trump, dan mengucapkan selamat atas kesuksesannya. Setelah itu, Prabowo pun kemudian menghadiri pertemuan Kerjasama Ekonomi Asia-Pasifik (APEC), dan ke KTT G20 di Rio de Janeiro.Jadwal perjalanan yang padat menunjukkan satu hal yang penting, kata Andreas Ufen, pakar Asia Tenggara di lembaga pemikir Institut Studi Global dan Area Jerman (GIGA) di Hamburg. Prabowo lebih menekankan peran internasional Indonesia dibandingkan para pendahulunya.Ayo berlangganan newsletter mingguan Wednesday Bite. Recharge pengetahuanmu di tengah minggu, biar topik obrolan makin seru!\"Dia ingin membuat Indonesia lebih dikenal secara internasional dan oleh karena itu menerapkan kebijakan luar negeri yang proaktif. Sejak kemerdekaan pada tahun 1945, Indonesia telah berupaya untuk mendorong kebijakan luar negeri yang bebas dan mandiri. Bahkan selama Perang Dingin, negara tersebut tidak mau bergabung dengan salah satu blok, tapi masih berpartisipasi aktif. Prabowo melanjutkan kebijakan ini dalam membentuk hubungan internasional,\" kata Andreas Ufen.Bukan kebetulan bahwa setelah menjabat, Prabowo langsung mengunjungi Cina dan Amerika Serikat, kata Denis Suarsana, kepala kantor Konrad Adenauer Foundation di Jakarta. \"Ia tidak hanya menunjukkan bahwa kedua negara adalah mitra yang paling penting bagi Indonesia, tapi juga bahwa kedua negara mempunyai kepentingan yang sama dalam sudut pandang Indonesia. Dan ketika ia kemudian mengambil bagian dalam KTT APEC di Peru dan pertemuan G20 di Brasil, dia juga secara tegas berkomitmen terhadap multilateralisme.\"Pada saat yang sama, Prabowo juga harus mempersiapkan Indonesia menghadapi pemerintahan Trump yang akan datang, yang arah politik dan ekonomi internasionalnya belum dapat ditebak.Ketika Prabowo membagikan percakapan teleponnya dengan Donald Trump di media sosial, ia menunjukkan bahwa ia berusaha menjaga hubungan pribadi yang baik dengan Trump, kata Suarsana.\"Prabowo tentu mengharapkan kebijakan yang lebih pragmatis terhadap Indonesia dari Trump. Secara khusus, diharapkan AS bisa lebih terlibat di bidang impor nikel. Dalam hal ini, ada optimisme tertentu di Indonesia bahwa pemerintahan Trump sebenarnya dapat \"ditangani\" dengan sangat baik.\"Pada saat yang sama, ada sejumlah hal yang harus dipikirkan, lanjut Suarsana. \"Jika Trump benar-benar mengenakan tarif sebesar 10 hingga 20 persen pada seluruh impor dan, khususnya, mengambil tindakan terhadap upaya Cina menghindari tarif ini lewat jalur perdagangan tidak langsung, misalnya melalui negara-negara Asia Tenggara, Indonesia juga dapat terkena dampak negatif yang sangat besar. Karena Indonesia secara alami terintegrasi ke dalam rantai pasokan Cina.\"Di sisi lain, Indonesia terus menunjukkan komitmennya sebagai mitra Amerika secara militer. Angkatan laut kedua negara mengadakan latihan bersama di dekat pulau Batam. Manuver ini dipandang sebagai upaya keduanya untuk melawan dominasi Cina di wilayah tersebut, menurut laporan portal online Asia Times. Namun Indonesia tidak memposisikan dirinya melawan Cina, kata Andreas Ufen.\"Prabowo berusaha menjaga hubungan baik dengan AS dan Cina. Dengan melakukan hal ini, ia mengikuti kebijakan yang tersebar luas di kawasan. Hampir semua negara berupaya menjaga hubungan baik dengan Cina dan AS dan tidak memihak pada satu pihak.\"Dalam pertemuan Prabowo dengan Xi Jinping, kedua negara menandatangani pernyataan bersama yang mengesankan bahwa Indonesia mengakui Sembilan Garis Putus yang dirumuskan Cina. Garis ini kontroversial karena menandai wilayah yang diklaim Cina, termasuk Kepulauan Natuna. Pengumuman ini menyebabkan keresahan besar di wilayah tersebut. Pernyataan bersama yang ditandatangani menyebabkan keresahan besar. Kementerian Luar Negeri RI kemudian menyatakan Indonesia tidak mengakui klaim teritorial Cina.Fakta bahwa Indonesia menandatangani deklarasi bersama tersebut mungkin disebabkan oleh kurangnya pengalaman diplomatis pemerintahan Prabowo, kata Andreas Ufen dalam wawancara dengan DW.\"Tapi saya rasa Indonesia tidak akan lebih condong ke Cina. Prabowo pada dasarnya mewakili posisi yang jelas-jelas condong ke Amerika. Selain itu, militer Indonesia mendapatkan hampir seluruh peralatan militernya dari negara-negara NATO, sangat sedikit yang berasal dari Cina. Dan Indonesia sangat bergantung pada Barat, khususnya Amerika, dalam hal kebijakan keamanan dan ekonomi.\"Hal serupa juga dilihat Denis Suarsana. Secara garis besar, hubungan Cina dan Indonesia baik. Perekonomian kedua negara saling bergantung dalam banyak hal. Dan Indonesia juga sudah menyatakan ingin bergabung dengan negara-negara BRICS.\"Di Barat, hal ini terkadang dianggap seolah-olah negara ini menjauh dari komunitas negara-negara Barat. Menurut saya, tidak demikian,\" kata Suarsana.\"Prabowo ingin bertukar pikiran tidak hanya dengan Cina, tapi juga dengan banyak kawasan dan negara di dunia. Hal ini misalnya ditunjukkan dengan keinginan Indonesia untuk bergabung dengan OECD. Ini keijakan luar negeri yang independen. Orang-orang di Jakarta yakin bahwa hal ini yang terbaik bagi negara.\"Diadaptasi dari artikel DW berbahasa Jerman(ita/ita)",

Wang Yi stated that China and Nepal are good neighbors, friends, and partners, and have always respected and supported each other since their establishment of diplomatic relations in 1955. In 2019, President Xi Jinping's historic state visit to Nepal elevated the bilateral relationship to a strategic partnership for development and prosperity. Both countries have made significant progress in cooperation, including the Belt and Road Initiative and the construction of a trans-Himalayan multi-dimensional connectivity network, which has brought tangible benefits to the Nepalese people. Wang Yi expressed China's willingness to work with Nepal to open up new prospects for bilateral relations on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. He also praised Nepal's consistent adherence to the One-China Principle and its support for China's core interests. China supports Nepal in maintaining its sovereignty, independence, and national dignity and exploring a development path suitable for its national conditions. Wang Yi emphasized that China's friendly policy towards Nepal remains unchanged and is aimed at all Nepalese people, and China is a reliable partner and friend in Nepal's development and revitalization. Azhu expressed Nepal's willingness to continue implementing the outcomes and important consensus of President Xi Jinping's visit. He stated that Nepal adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, upholds friendly relations, and respects each other, forming a deep brotherhood. Nepal is committed to the One-China Policy and considers Tibet and Taiwan as inseparable parts of China's territory, opposing any activities that harm China's interests and interference in China's internal affairs. Azhu praised China's remarkable achievements, especially in poverty alleviation, and expressed gratitude for China's long-term support for Nepal's national development and livelihood improvement. He also expressed confidence in Nepal's prosperity and development with China's support. Both sides exchanged views on practical cooperation in various fields and reached broad consensus.

However, this approach has yet to yield productive outcomes, and it has heightened security concerns, especially for foreign nationals in the country. Chinese nationals, in particular, have been targeted twice within six months, and a convoy of foreign diplomats narrowly escaped an attack while visiting Swat in KP. China, facing specific security concerns, has been urging Pakistan to intensify its efforts against terrorist groups that threaten its interests.\n\nChina has been using high-level diplomatic channels to convey its security concerns to the Pakistani leadership, initially pushing the latter to announce a comprehensive campaign against terrorism and extremism under the tag of ‘Operation Azm-i-Istehkam’ and then recently by pressuring Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif to announce that he would personally oversee the investigation into last month’s terrorist attack on Chinese nationals in Karachi.\n\nHowever, these assurances from Pakistan have done little to ease Beijing’s concerns. A recent statement by the Chinese ambassador to Pakistan, Jiang Zaidong, is a reflection of this frustration. At a public seminar, Ambassador Zaidong rebuffed Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, rejecting his praise of China’s patience amid security threats. He stated unequivocally that two deadly attacks within six months were unacceptable and urged the Pakistani government to launch a comprehensive crackdown on all anti-China terrorist groups.\n\nWhat can Pakistan do to address the Chinese concerns? What has Operation Azm-i-Istehkam achieved so far, and how sustainable is the campaign? These questions are essential, especially with regard to interpreting the Chinese demand for decisive action against the terrorists. Suppose it is conceived that full-scale military operations in Balochistan and KP eliminate the terrorist networks. This is a critical demand, as full-scale military operations are not viable.\n\nWhat can Pakistan do to address the Chinese concerns?\n\nIt has been argued on these pages that any large-scale military operation in Balochistan would complicate the province’s political and security crisis, and there is a need to adopt a very delicate approach. For threats such as those emanating from the likes of the banned TTP and the ISKP, Pakistan needs full cooperation from the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which the Taliban are resisting by helping the TTP instead. The alternative is cross-border action to eliminate the threats, which would have its own political and security implications, and will further strengthen the bond between the Taliban and TTP.\n\nIf China understands Pakistan’s position on the non-viability of military operations, what should the other options be? China seems to want deeper cooperation in the security sector. The ongoing formal cooperation between the two countries is not producing enough trust, so China has proposed a joint security mechanism.\n\nMedia reports reveal that during Chinese Premier Li Qiang’s recent visit, a proposal for a joint security mechanism was discussed as a critical condition for securing major infrastructure and energy deals with Pakistan. A vital outcome of the visit was signing agreements to provide Pakistan’s law enforcement, tasked with protecting Chinese nationals, with six bulletproof vehicles and approximately 20 firefighting trucks.\n\nPakistan has not been in favour of a formal Chinese security presence within its borders, having itself developed extensive infrastructure to secure CPEC and protect Chinese nationals. We have mentioned in an earlier column, too, that in 2016, the Special Security Division was established, comprising 34 and 44 Light Infantry Divisions, with 15,000 troops each. According to some reports, the 34 Light Division was created in 2016, followed by the 44 Light Division in 2020. The SSD is also supported by 32,000 security personnel from the Frontier Corps, police, and Levies. There is reportedly a dedicated intelligence network to detect and eliminate terrorism-related threats. Despite this robust security infrastructure, attacks on Chinese nationals have persisted.\n\nNotably, no terrorist attacks have been reported at project sites. Except for the 2018 assault on the Chinese consulate in Karachi, all recorded attacks have occurred while Chinese workers were travelling between locations.\n\nIn response to the Dasu attack on a bus carrying Chinese workers, the government has reaffirmed its commitment to the safety of Chinese nationals by tightening standard operating procedures and adding extra security layers. Responsibilities for police forces have been extended down to the district level, with district administrations and provincial governments required to review security plans for Chinese nationals monthly, alter travel routes, and implement other precautionary measures. An investigation will determine whether provincial and district administrations have been vigilant in ensuring the safety of Chinese nationals. According to the SOPs, Chinese nationals must travel in B-6-level armoured vehicles to minimise risks.\n\nThe October attack on Chinese nationals in Karachi highlighted vulnerabilities within security institutions and exposed lapses in SOP enforcement. While details about the joint security mechanism between China and Pakistan remain limited, it is seen as a possibility that Chinese private security companies may become involved in providing inner-circle security for Chinese workers, a step that would respect Pakistan’s sovereignty. One can imagine this would be an initial step, and if security threats were not prevented, the cooperation would go deeper.\n\nThe issue lies not in the sincerity and dedication of Pakistan’s law enforcement but in their capacity and access to effective surveillance equipment, which could make a significant difference. With more substantial resources, Pakistan might have been able to avoid the need for a joint security mechanism. Now, it appears increasingly difficult to avert this initiative.

The author, Farhan Hanif Siddiqi, a professor at the University of Karachi, argues that the narrative of India-Pakistan relations is not solely defined by competition and hostility but also includes periods of cooperation. He points out that these cooperative periods are often overlooked and undervalued, yet they demonstrate that even in times of high tension, the two nuclear-armed neighbors can engage in collaboration. The article references the 2019 Pulwama attack and subsequent events that led to a freeze in relations, but also notes the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor for Sikh pilgrims, which allowed for visa-free travel. The author further discusses the 1999 Kargil conflict and the subsequent efforts by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and Indian Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh to engage in diplomatic dialogue and secret negotiations aimed at resolving the Kashmir conflict. Despite ongoing tensions, the 2021 ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control has largely held, reducing hostilities. The article concludes that while trade relations have been affected, informal trade continues, and the potential for more substantial bilateral engagement depends on visionary leadership that prioritizes long-term goals over short-term gains.",
                                    "content": "参考消息网11月12日报道 香港《南华早报》网站11月10日刊登题为《为什么印巴关系需要一个接触的新时代》的文章，作者是巴基斯坦真纳大学政治与国际关系学院教授法尔汉·哈尼夫·西迪基。全文摘编如下：围绕印度与巴基斯坦关系的讨论通常围绕着两个问题：它们能否管理好彼此的竞争？如何才能促进双边关系的友好发展？虽然这些问题很重要，但也掩盖了一个关键的现实：尽管印度和巴基斯坦长期以来一直存在敌意，但两国偶尔也会进行建设性的接触。这些合作时期经常被忽视和低估，但让我们了解到，即使在高度紧张的局势下，这两个拥有核武器的对手也可能开展合作。这种冲突与接触的二元性是两国后殖民历史的特征，呈现出一种复杂的叙事：竞争中穿插着合作的尝试。2019年是这种冲突-接触动态的深刻写照。2月，印控克什米尔普尔瓦马发生的恐怖袭击导致印度对巴基斯坦领土发动报复性空袭，进而升级为空中混战，导致一名印度飞行员被俘。同年8月，印度政府取消印控克什米尔的特殊宪法地位，导致印巴关系冻结。此后，双边贸易实际上停止，外交关系降级，民间交流急剧减少。巴基斯坦一再坚称，任何对话都必须从恢复印控克什米尔以前的地位开始，而印度则要求伊斯兰堡放弃对有争议地区分离主义叛乱的支持，印度称其为“跨境恐怖主义”。这些僵化立场自2019年以来一直阻碍两国政府之间有意义的对话。然而，在这些紧张局势中，两国在2019年11月同意开放格尔达布尔走廊，允许印度锡克教徒前往巴基斯坦朝圣。这种免签证入境展示印巴关系的不同的侧面：尽管存在普遍的敌对情绪，但双方仍愿意进行接触。印巴在敌对和建设性接触之间摇摆不定。1999年格尔吉尔冲突后，巴基斯坦时任总统佩尔韦兹·穆沙拉夫寻求重新定义与印度的关系，与印度总理阿塔尔·比哈里·瓦杰帕伊及其继任者曼莫汉·辛格合作，促进外交对话和秘密谈判。这些会谈为解决克什米尔冲突制定了一个创新而激进的框架。拟议的框架包括放宽控制线沿线的旅行限制、实现该地区的非军事化，以及通过联合管理机制赋予克什米尔人自治权。2007年辛格总理提出了南亚边境开放的愿景，人们可以“在阿姆利则吃早餐，在拉合尔吃午餐，在喀布尔吃晚餐”。尽管紧张局势仍在持续，但2021年达成的印巴停火协议仍在控制线沿线有效，表明即使在地缘政治紧张局势下也有合作的可能。该协议使敌对行动大大减少，以前动荡不安的边境地区现在三年多来基本保持和平。自2019年以来，巴基斯坦暂停对印贸易关系，印度则取消对巴基斯坦的“最惠国”待遇，将巴基斯坦商品的进口关税提高到200%，两国之间的贸易大幅下降。具有讽刺意味的是，两国继续通过第三国进行间接贸易，去年印度向巴基斯坦出口了价值约12亿美元的商品和服务，巴基斯坦向印度出口了价值300万美元的商品和服务。停火协议的成功和非正式贸易的继续表明双方都有接触的意愿。能否恢复类似于20年前的更具实质性的双边接触，取决于两国富有想象力和勇气的领导力。这种领导力必须优先考虑长期愿景，而不是短期的零和结果。如果合作努力得到加强，整个南亚都将受益。（编译/张琳）",

The interior and planning ministries did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement last week, Pakistan's interior ministry said both sides agreed to develop a joint strategy to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n'GRAVE SECURITY BREACH'\n\nThe nature of the Karachi bombing has angered Beijing, which is now pushing harder to achieve a long standing demand to control security arrangements for its citizens.\n\nA pick-up truck rigged with nearly 100 kg (220 lbs) of explosives waited unchecked for about 40 minutes near the outermost security cordon of the heavily guarded airport before its driver rammed it into a vehicle carrying Chinese engineers, officials said.\n\n\"It was a grave security breach,\" admitted one of the officials investigating the bombing, which came just a week before Chinese Premier Li Qiang's visit to Islamabad, the first such trip in a decade.\n\nThe official said investigators believe the attackers had \"inside help\" in securing details of the itinerary and route of the engineers, who had returned from a month off in Thailand.\n\nThey were to be escorted back to a power plant set up as part of plans for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).\n\nLongtime Pakistan ally China has thousands of nationals working on projects grouped under the CPEC, a $65-billion investment in President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to expand China's global reach by road, rail and sea.\n\n'CHINESE FRUSTRATIONS'\n\nPublicly China has mostly backed Pakistan's arrangements, even as it calls for enhanced security.\n\nPrivately, Beijing has expressed frustration. At one recent meeting, the Chinese side provided evidence that Pakistan had failed to follow security protocols agreed on twice in recent months, three officials said.\n\nSuch protocols usually feature high standards for deployment and movement of Chinese officials.\n\nChinese nationals have been in the crosshairs of separatist militants who see Beijing as helping Pakistan exploit minerals in the underdeveloped southwestern province of Balochistan, where China has a strategic port and mining interests.\n\nThousands of Pakistani security officers from the army, police and a dedicated force called the Special Protection Unit are posted to guard Chinese nationals.\n\nOnly China's embassy in Islamabad and its consulates are allowed Chinese official security personnel, the Pakistani officials said.\n\nReporting by Asif Shahzad; Additional reporting by Joe Cash and Ethan Wang in Beijing; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Ed Osmond\n\nXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing Rights\n\nAsif ShahzadThomson ReutersShahzad is an accomplished media professional, with over two decades of experience.

He emphasized that Afghanistan should be a platform for cooperation rather than a field for geopolitical competition. Yue expressed concern over the presence of militant groups in Afghanistan and the need for an inclusive government. He also addressed the situation of women and human rights, stating that addressing poverty, hunger, and famine is essential to ensuring human rights. Yue criticized Western countries for what he called \"double standards\" and announced that he is negotiating with the Islamic Emirate to provide humanitarian aid of 1 billion yuan ($138 million) from China.",

Furthermore, addressing poverty, hunger, and famine is essential to ensuring human rights.”\r\n\nIn the past three years, U.S. officials have repeatedly expressed concerns about China’s influence in Afghanistan. Similarly, Donald Trump, during his election campaigns, repeatedly claimed that the Bagram airbase had fallen into China’s hands.\n\nYue meanwhile also criticized Western countries for what he called \"double standards\" and said: \"In order to ensure human rights, the issue of poverty, hunger and famine in Afghanistan must be addressed.\"\n\nYue also announced that he is negotiating with the Islamic Emirate to provide humanitarian aid of 1 billion yuan ($138 million) from China.\n\nHe said that part of this aid will go to Afghanistan, as well as Pakistan and Iran, so that an arrangement can be made for the return of migrants to their country.",

Yue also emphasized the responsibility of Afghanistan’s neighbors and regional partners to collaborate in supporting the nation’s peace, stability, and reconstruction efforts.

This year at least 7 Chinese nationals were killed in two different terrorist attacks.\n\nPakistan’s investigations into the March 26 Besham terrorist attack concluded that there was a network connected to TTP was behind the attack. The probe also revealed that the suicide bomber was an Afghan national and the vehicle used in the attack was smuggled into Pakistan.\n\nSimilarly, Pakistan believes Baloch terrorist groups are now closely working with the TTP and also have their training camps in Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, unlike other countries, China usually follows a carefully crafted policy where such concerns are conveyed from behind closed doors.\n\nOfficials here believe that they have this understanding that the Chinese envoy forcefully raised the issue of terrorist sanctuaries with the Afghan leadership.\n\nA statement issued by the Afghan Deputy Prime Minister’s Office indicated that Pakistan, and Afghanistan relationship was one of the subjects of discussions.\n\nAccording to the statement, Mr Yue Xiaoyong commended Afghanistan’s progress over the past three years and stressed the significance of fostering improved relations and mutual understanding among Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China.\n\nThe reference to Pakistan, Afghanistan and China, according to observers, shows that Beijing is keen to see issues between Islamabad and Kabul are sorted out.\n\nThe Afghan deputy prime minister told the Chinese envoy that the Islamic Emirate has consistently guaranteed its neighbours and the international community that Afghanistan poses no threat to any nation and has upheld this assurance over the past three years.\n\n“The Deputy Prime Minister further noted that Afghanistan is transitioning from a prolonged period of conflict and is prioritizing the revitalisation of its national economy and the expansion of regional cooperation,” according to the readout, which suggests that the Afghan side tried to placate concerns of China and Pakistan.",

                                    "abstract": "Pakistan may seek China's assistance in exerting pressure on Baloch militant sanctuaries located in Afghanistan.",
                                    "content": "The Pakistan government’s recent announcement regarding a comprehensive military operation in Balochistan has garnered significant attention amidst a backdrop of rising terror attacks in the country. The decision, made by the Federal Apex Committee of the National Action Plan, which includes all military services’ chiefs and the top civilian leadership, underscores a concerted effort to address the escalating threat posed by terrorist organizations operating in this strategically important province. The operation is aimed at combating groups that have been targeting civilians and foreign nationals, with a view to disrupt Pakistan’s economic progress through acts of violence orchestrated by hostile external powers. It is a response to ongoing security challenges, particularly those associated with the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other outlawed factions that have increasingly targeted Chinese nationals and Pakistani security forces. Moreover, it is essential to acknowledge that Balochistan is not the only province facing heightened insecurity. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) has also seen a surge in militant activities attributed to groups such as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates. While specifics regarding the newly announced military operation, such as whether it will incorporate ground or air strikes or target specific districts along the Iran border, have not been disclosed, there are indications that the strategy will involve coordination with China. This collaboration is particularly pertinent given China's concerns for its citizens following numerous attacks linked to Baloch militant groups. Earlier this year, reports suggested that China had urged Pakistan to undertake substantial offensive measures against these militants, reminiscent of Operation Zarb-e-Azb — a campaign that successfully neutralized TTP strongholds in tribal areas nearly a decade ago. Notably, the announcement of a new military operation in Balochistan follows previous declarations regarding Operation Azm-e-Istehkam. The announcement of Operation Azm-e-Istehkam in earlier this year triggered significant debate across Pakistan, raising questions regarding the government's intentions. In response to these concerns, government officials clarified that the operation was intended to accelerate ongoing counterterror offensives rather than introduce a new strategy. As part of the operation, the objective was reportedly to engage regional players in an effort to diminish the support base for militant groups operating outside Pakistan’s borders. This latest operation targeting Balochistan appears to align with the broader strategy being followed under Azm-e-Istehkam that emphasizes intelligence-based operations throughout the province. It is important to note that this approach will not entail a substantial deployment of troops aimed at clearing vast areas within Balochistan. Instead, it seems to focus on enhancing coordination between Pakistan and China in addressing militant threats. Balochistan has long grappled with issues related to militancy, and previous operations have failed to significantly alter this troubling trend. The province's expansive territory presents challenges for containment strategies against hit-and-run tactics, ambushes, and suicide bombings. Militants benefit from their proximity to borders with Afghanistan and Iran, utilizing hideouts across these regions that complicate any major ground offensive by Pakistani forces. As part of the operation in Balochistan, Pakistan may adopt a more assertive stance in seeking China's assistance in exerting pressure on Baloch militant sanctuaries located beyond its borders. Recent developments indicate that Pakistan has presented evidence of terrorist support originating from Afghanistan during discussions with Chinese officials. Notably, China's envoy for Afghanistan has visited Pakistan as part of these diplomatic engagements. China's involvement could signify an emerging role in assisting Pakistan with its counterterrorism efforts related specifically to Afghanistan. This collaboration aims to restore stability in Balochistan — a region critical for both the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project and China's broader Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Ultimately, while the operation in Balochistan may not represent a departure from existing anti-terror strategies on the ground, it signals a renewed commitment by Pakistani authorities to enhance military efforts coupled with regional initiatives aimed at isolating militant support networks. The effectiveness of this approach remains uncertain and will be closely monitored as developments unfold. In light of these developments, stakeholders within Pakistan’s political landscape must engage in transparent dialogue regarding operational objectives and expected outcomes. Such discussions will not only clarify governmental strategies but also foster trust among citizens who seek assurance amid rising threats from extremist elements.",

                                    "content": "Islamabad, Nov 28 (PTI) Pakistan and China military officials held talks on counter-terrorism and regional security amid unease following the recent attacks on Chinese nationals. General Zhang Youxia, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) China and one of China's two top military leaders, is visiting Pakistan along with a high-level delegation, according to a military statement. General Zhang held a one-on-one meeting with Army Chief Gen Asim Munir on Wednesday, followed by delegation-level discussions. According to the statement, the engagements focused on 'matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics, measures for regional stability, and enhancing bilateral defence cooperation.' General Zhang spoke about Pakistan's ongoing counter-terrorism efforts, which remain a key topic of discussion between the two countries due to the rising frequency of attacks targeting Chinese nationals working in Pakistan. Newspaper Dawn reported that there have been media reports that Beijing is seeking a more proactive role in ensuring the safety of its citizens in Pakistan, but the Foreign Office has emphasised that counter-terrorism cooperation between the two countries is based on mutual respect for each other's sovereignty. Under the regional stability head, the two sides exchanged views about the Indian role in the region and the developments in Afghanistan, particularly the presence of terrorist groups, Dawn added. The CMC vice chairman's visit follows a trip by Gen Li Qiaoming, commander of the People's Liberation Army Ground Forces, to Pakistan in late August. Additionally, over 300 Chinese troops arrived in Pakistan to take part in the joint China-Pakistan anti-terrorism exercise, Warrior-VIII, amid escalating militant attacks in the country. The opening ceremony for the drills was held on Wednesday, a report posted on the Chinese Defence Ministry's official website said. Running until mid-December, the drills aim to enhance joint counter-terrorism operational capabilities. During the talks on Wednesday, General Munir highlighted the resilience of Pakistan-China relations, noting their ability to withstand shifts in international and regional dynamics. He expressed gratitude for China's unwavering support for Pakistan. General Zhang, in turn, praised Pakistan's dedication to the strategic partnership and reaffirmed China's commitment to strengthening the enduring bilateral relationship, the statement added. The two generals last met in Beijing in April 2023, where General Zhang pledged to deepen and expand practical cooperation, elevate military-to-military ties, and jointly safeguard the common interests of both countries while promoting regional peace and stability, reported Dawn. The ties between Pakistan and China have come under strain as Chinese nationals have frequently come under attack from terrorists and separatist groups in different parts of the country. The talks and the drills follow this week's attack when at least 50 persons were killed and 20 injured when militants ambushed three vehicles in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Thursday. The attacks involving suicide bombers have been taking place despite Pakistan deploying over 30,000 security personnel to guard Chinese citizens in the country. Last month, two Chinese engineers were among those killed in a suicide bomb attack near Karachi airport drawing a strong reaction from the Chinese government over the security of their citizens in Pakistan. Separatist groups have targeted Chinese nationals working in Pakistan on several private projects and also those under the aegis of the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).",

General Zhang Youxia, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) China and one of Beijing's top military leaders, who is in Pakistan along with a high-level delegation, held a one-on-one meeting with Army Chief Gen Asim Munir on Wednesday. Following the meeting between the two, there were delegation-level discussions focused on matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics, measures for regional stability, and enhancing bilateral defence cooperation. General Zhang spoke about Pakistan's ongoing counter-terrorism efforts, which remain a major topic of discussion between the two countries in the wake of incidents of frequent attacks on Chinese nationals working in Pakistan.

He affirmed that this historic partnership has withstood the test of time and is poised to grow further. General Zhang praised Pakistan's dedication to the strategic partnership and reaffirmed China's commitment to strengthening the enduring bilateral relationship, according to a statement. According to a report in Dawn, Beijing is reportedly seeking a more proactive role in ensuring the safety of its citizens in Pakistan, but the Foreign Office has emphasised that counter-terrorism cooperation between the two countries is based on mutual respect for each other's sovereignty.

                                    "abstract": "The Chinese military high command recently visited Islamabad, Pakistan, where they held a one-on-one meeting with the head of the Pakistani military, Army Chief of Staff General Munir, followed by a delegation-level dialogue. According to a statement issued by the Pakistani military after the meeting, the talks focused on common interests between China and Pakistan, regional security dynamics, regional stability measures, and strengthening bilateral defense cooperation. The visit took place against the backdrop of Pakistan's severe security situation, with frequent attacks targeting Sino-Pakistani cooperation projects, which has raised concerns for both China and Pakistan. The two countries are further enhancing their security cooperation and intensifying anti-terrorism efforts, which are now urgent. On the same day the Chinese military high command arrived in Islamabad, China and Pakistan launched a new round of joint counter-terrorism exercises, which will continue until mid-December, aimed at enhancing their joint response to security issues. This has led to speculation about reports in the Pakistani media suggesting that China might deploy troops to Pakistan for counter-terrorism, although this has not been confirmed and is not directly related to the joint exercises. The strategic talks between the two military leaders also focused on India's role in the region, developments in Afghanistan, and the presence of terrorist organizations. Pakistan informed China about the progress of regional situations, highlighting India's involvement in the region. Pakistan has been working hard on counter-terrorism domestically, but the security situation has not improved fundamentally, partly due to internal and external factors. Internally, there are separatist movements in regions like Balochistan, and externally, Pakistan has neighbors like India and Afghanistan. India's role in Pakistan's security situation has been a long-standing concern for Pakistan, with both countries accusing each other of supporting terrorism. Pakistan has been gathering evidence to prove that India is deliberately supporting terrorist groups within Pakistan, hindering its counter-terrorism efforts. Despite these accusations, India has never responded officially. There is also a significant amount of anti-Pakistan sentiment in the Indian media, with some \"scholars\" advocating for \"moral and financial support\" to separatist groups in Pakistan. Given the current geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan, India has a strong motive to keep Pakistan preoccupied with security issues. Afghanistan is another concern, as the Taliban use Afghan territory to infiltrate Pakistan, and the interim government has been ineffective in addressing this issue. In light of these challenges, Pakistan's cooperation with China is crucial, leading to the new round of joint counter-terrorism exercises and strategic talks in Islamabad. General Munir expressed gratitude for China's steadfast support, emphasizing the resilience of the Sino-Pakistani relationship, which can withstand changes in international and regional situations. This resilience forms the basis for continued security cooperation between China and Pakistan. However, to achieve practical results in joint counter-terrorism, more than just statements are needed. In the face of Pakistan's increasingly severe security situation, both China and Pakistan need to explore new ways to enhance cooperation. This is not just a bilateral issue but one that requires regional countries to work together to find solutions. As both China and Pakistan are members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), if they can develop new models for security cooperation, it could provide a reference and inspiration for future security cooperation within the SCO.",
                                    "content": "邻国巴基斯坦放出消息称，解放军高层日前到访伊斯兰堡，先是和巴军方一把手，陆军参谋长穆尼尔举行一对一会谈，随后中巴两军进行了代表团级别的对话。根据巴基斯坦军方会后发表的声明，此次会谈重点讨论了中国与巴基斯坦的共同利益、地区安全动态、地区稳定措施以及加强双边防务合作等等。【解放军高层到访伊斯兰堡，巴基斯坦军方一把手穆尼尔出面接待】另外补充一句，我方此次访问的背景，建立在巴基斯坦严峻的安全形势之上，这段时间以来，巴基斯坦的袭击事件层出不穷，不少都是冲着中巴合作项目来的，这已经引起了中国与巴基斯坦的共同担忧。两国安全合作更进一步，加强反恐力度已经是刻不容缓。而中国军方高层抵达伊斯兰堡的同一天，中巴正开展新一轮联合反恐演习，一直持续到12月中旬，旨在提高两国共同应对安全问题的能力。这很容易让人联想到，前不久巴基斯坦媒体那边一度传出，所谓中国将要在巴基斯坦“出兵反恐”，但有必要指出，这一消息尚未得到进一步的证实，也与新一轮中巴联合反恐演习没有必然的关联。回到这一轮中巴战略会谈上来，更详细的通报显示，两军高层这次会面，主要就印度在该地区的作用，阿富汗局势的事态发展，尤其是恐怖组织的存在交换意见。【中巴两军高层这次重点讨论安全问题】说得再直白点，就是巴基斯坦向中方通报了地区局势的进展，直点出了印度的手脚有多么的不安分。事实上，巴基斯坦这段时间在国内反恐问题上付出的种种努力，中国这边都是看在眼里的，但安全局势之所以没有得到根本好转，甚至是“越反越恐”，很大程度上是内外因素共同作用的结果。如果说内部因素还能指望巴基斯坦自己解决，但外部因素的介入与干涉，就离不开与周边国家，尤其是中国的协调了。对内，是俾路支等地区有分离主义作祟，与中央政府离心离德，对外则是巴基斯坦旁边有印度和阿富汗这两个邻居。【解放军投送力量进入巴基斯坦，参加勇士-8联合反恐演习】印度这个邻国在巴基斯坦安全局势上扮演的微妙角色，一直都是巴基斯坦的一个心病。长期以来，印度与巴基斯坦互相指责对方在地区安全上的不作为，都为彼此扣上了一个“支持恐怖主义”的大帽子。不过这种口水仗打了这么多年，一直没有结果，无非是让两边关系更加冷淡。而巴基斯坦军方这几年下来，一直在搜集证据，试图证明印度在有预谋地扶持巴基斯坦境内的极端组织，让自己的反恐工作始终难以取得成效。曾经他们在新闻发布会上展示了不少重量级证据，称印度利用驻外使馆资助、甚至是训练巴基斯坦的恐怖组织，其中就包括巴基斯坦塔利班，还有“俾路支解放军”。去年，巴基斯坦军方还在俾路支省钓出一条大鱼，一个曾经为恐怖组织卖命的头目，带着部下集体投降，然后抖出了不少猛料，说印度一直在对俾路支省的恐怖活动提供直接的支持。【半年前的达苏水电站袭击事件，巴方人员前来吊唁】只不过对于这些指控，印度政府从来没有给出正面回应。只不过有个迹象值得注意，印度的舆论场，对巴基斯坦的敌意很重，不少所谓的“学者”，常常鼓吹，要对巴基斯坦内部的分离主义分子提供“道义和资金支持”。而且以印巴两国现在的地缘政治矛盾，印度肯定有充分的动机，让巴基斯坦在安全问题上焦头烂额。至于阿富汗那边，主要是巴塔利用阿富汗领土对巴基斯坦进行渗透活动，而临时政府在这个问题上毫无作为，让巴基斯坦很有意见。何况阿富汗安全局势同样不容乐观，一旦危机外溢，巴基斯坦肯定是最先受到影响的那一个。所以面对这种内外交困的局面，巴基斯坦加强与中国的合作，就很有必要了，所以就有了新一轮中巴联合反恐演习，还有两军高层在伊斯兰堡的战略会谈。【就巴塔问题，巴基斯坦交涉多次始终无果】巴基斯坦陆军参谋长穆尼尔将军还特意表示，感谢中国对巴基斯坦的坚定支持，巴基斯坦与中国的关系具有韧性，能够经受国际和地区形势的变化。从我们的角度而言，这种韧性，也是中巴得以在安全层面上持续深化合作的基础。但实事求是地说，要想中巴联合反恐取得实际成效，光靠表态是远远不够的，面对巴基斯坦日益严峻的安全局势，中巴都需要摸索一条加强合作的新道路。而且这不只是中国与巴基斯坦之间的问题，也需要地区国家共同面对、合作解决。中巴同为上合成员国，如果能在安全合作钻研出新的模式，也能为日后上合内部的安全合作提供参考和借鉴的思路。",

I hope these relations will revolve around safeguarding the national interests of both sides,” said Mohammad Zalmay Afghanyar, a political affairs expert.\n\nChina and Russia are among the countries close to Afghanistan’s caretaker government and have repeatedly emphasized their support for Afghanistan in achieving peace and stability.",

Repeated assurances from the Taliban, including during the ongoing visit, that they won’t allow the use of Afghan territory against India seems to have convinced India that this might be the right time to deepen engagement with Kabul.Yaqub has in the past expressed hope of stronger ties with India, leading also to cooperation in defence sector. The Taliban have been pushing India to allow the appointment of a diplomat from the Taliban foreign ministry in the Afghan embassy in New Delhi, saying ties between India and Afghanistan are important for both countries and people. Ironically, the Taliban’s relationship with Pakistan has continued to head south because of differences over the activities of Pakistan Taliban.",

                                    "content": "November 7, 2024\n\nIslamabad — Afghanistan’s Taliban government has held talks with India on improving bilateral ties and seeking increased humanitarian assistance for the impoverished country, officials reported Thursday.\n\nJitender Pal Singh, the Indian foreign ministry’s point-person for Afghanistan, led his delegation’s meetings with Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and a rare interaction with Defense Minister Mohammad Yaqoob, among others, during the November 4-5 visit to Kabul.\n\n“Yes, this was the first meeting with” Yaqoob, Indian media quoted Randhir Jaiswal, the foreign ministry spokesperson, as telling a weekly news conference in New Delhi on Thursday.\n\nJaiswal stated that “humanitarian assistance from India was the centerpiece of the meetings of JP Singh with Afghan officials.” He added that the Indian delegation also met with representatives of the United Nations agencies in Kabul.\n\nThe spokesperson discussed the visit a day after Yaqoob’s office publicly shared details of his meeting with the visiting Indian delegation. It read that “both sides declared their common desire to enlarge the bilateral relations … and expressed their interest in further reinforcing the interactions between Afghanistan and India.”\n\nBoth sides reported that the discussions in Kabul also focused on how the Afghan business community could access the India-operated Chabahar port in Iran, which borders landlocked Afghanistan, to increase bilateral trade.\n\nOn Thursday, Muttaqi’s office released details of his talks with Singh, saying the Taliban chief diplomat emphasized the need to improve bilateral political and economic relations and sought better visa facilitation for Afghan businessmen to help boost trade ties with India.\n\nThe Taliban statement quoted Singh as describing New Delhi’s relations with Kabul as historic and “important for his country.” He promised to enhance Indian visa facilities for Afghans, it added.\n\nThe de facto Afghan leaders swept back to power in August 2021, when the United States and NATO troops left the country after almost two decades of war with the then-insurgent Taliban.\n\nThe Taliban takeover prompted New Delhi and Western countries to close their embassies in Kabul and mostly moved their diplomatic missions to Qatar.\n\nNo country has formally recognized the Taliban as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan, but several neighboring and regional countries, including China, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, and Qatar, have retained their embassies. India recently reopened its diplomatic mission in Kabul, manned by low-level diplomats.\n\nThe International community has refused to recognize the Taliban regime over human rights violations, particularly its restrictions on Afghan women’s access to work and education.\n\nIndia’s engagement with the de facto authorities in Afghanistan is expected to raise apprehensions in neighboring Pakistan, as noted by analysts.\n\nKabul’s ties with Islamabad lately have been strained over allegations that the Taliban harbor and support fugitive anti-Pakistan militants responsible for deadly “terrorist” attacks against Pakistani civilians and security forces.\n\nThe Pakistani military reported a fresh militant attack Thursday in a district on the Afghan border, saying the ensuing clashes killed four soldiers and five assailants.\n\nTaliban officials have denied Islamabad’s allegations, stating that no foreign militants are present in Afghanistan, and no one is allowed to use their territory to threaten neighboring countries.\n\nPakistan officially recognized the first Taliban government in Kabul in the 1990s. It allegedly harbored and supported Taliban leaders, who directed years of insurgent attacks against U.S.-led international forces in Afghanistan after being dislodged from power in late 2001.",

Although India did not sever all relations with the Taliban upon their rise to power, it has kept them at a level that can hardly be described as ideal. With the fall of the Afghan republic, the general perception was that India had lost the game in favor of Pakistan. This perception didn’t seem entirely unrealistic in the early days of the Taliban’s rule. Pakistan’s ISI openly acted as a power broker, resolving the deadlock in the Taliban’s cabinet formation, allowing the Pakistani military to flaunt its influence over India more than ever. But as time passed, it became clear that Islamabad had viewed the situation overly optimistically. The belief that Pakistan’s military had won both the political and military game in Afghanistan proved mistaken, as New Delhi was unlikely to easily abandon the scene. Gradually, Taliban officials openly expressed their desire to improve relations with India, and India’s embassy in Kabul resumed its operations.

                                    "content": "India is taking advantage of tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan by seeking to divert Afghan commerce from Pakistani routes to an Iranian port run by an Indian company in a move seen by analysts as a bid to boost its security and trade links with Kabul.\nA high-level delegation from India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), led by Joint Secretary J.P. Singh, visited Kabul on November 4 and 5. The delegation met with Afghan Defence Minister Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, and heads of UN agencies in Kabul. Among their discussion topics was Iran’s Chabahar port, operated by India Ports Global Limited.\n“They had discussions on India’s humanitarian assistance, how the Chabahar port can be utilised by the business community in Afghanistan for transactions, export and import, and any other things that they would like to do,” MEA spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said at a press briefing last week.\nIn a social media post, the Taliban’s defence ministry confirmed that Yaqoob met with the Indian delegation to discuss avenues for expanding their relations. Muttaqi’s office has also released details of his talks with Singh, noting that the Taliban’s chief diplomat urged stronger bilateral political and economic ties and requested easier visas for Afghan businessmen to travel to India.\nKabir Taneja, an associate fellow with the Observer Research Foundation Strategic Studies Programme in New Delhi, said India has been trying to promote Chabahar port as an alternative trade route for Afghanistan for a while now.\n“[Chabahar is] part of the core design of the project. It is to also give Kabul an alternative to Karachi port, which Afghanistan has used as a primary port for a long time,” Taneja said.\n\nIndia does not officially recognise the Taliban regime, which has ruled Afghanistan after the US pulled its forces out of the country in 2021. Nonetheless, India deployed a “technical team” to Afghanistan in 2022 and has been involved in humanitarian work there.\nTaneja said despite India’s non-recognition of the Taliban government, it was sensible for New Delhi to pursue the port issue.\n“Relations between Pakistan and the Taliban-led government in Kabul are deteriorating with border skirmishes and overall security and political-related differences coming forward,” Taneja said. The visit of Afghanistan’s Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar to Chabahar in November last year was a sign of this shift towards India, he added.\nDuring Baradar’s visit, he met with Indian officials to discuss boosting Afghanistan’s exports and imports.\nIn May, India and Iran signed a 10-year agreement to develop the Chabahar port in Sistan-Baluchistan province, near Iran’s border with Pakistan.\nObservers saw the pact as India adopting a more assertive stance by leveraging the strategically important facility to lessen Afghanistan’s reliance on Pakistan’s Gwadar port, a key project under China’s Belt and Road Initiative.\nShanthie Mariet D’Souza, a Fulbright-Nehru visiting chair at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, said Chabahar was a vital infrastructure hub where the interests of Afghanistan, Iran, and India intersect.\n\n“New Delhi’s efforts to establish trade links with Central Asia through Chabahar were delayed during the civilian rule in Afghanistan mainly due to security concerns. However, with the Taliban now in power, these security issues are less of a barrier,” D’Souza said.\n“Afghanistan, under the Taliban, is eager to enhance its trade through Chabahar to reduce dependence on Pakistan for trade and transit. To facilitate the Chabahar route as part of its Connect Central Asia policy, India needs to maintain positive relations with the Taliban,” she said.\nIndia’s primary motivation for engaging with Afghanistan is security, analysts say.\nAs long as the “terrorism risk” related to Afghanistan could be lowered to meet India’s counterterrorism objectives, the bilateral engagement would continue, said Antoine Levesques, a Research Fellow for South and Central Asian Defence, Strategy and Diplomacy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).\nAfter the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, militant groups like Jaishe-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which are considered close to the Taliban, have reportedly used American-made weapons in their operations in the disputed region of Indian-administered Kashmir.\nLevesques said Delhi’s secondary motive in reaching out to Kabul was to signal to Pakistan that the Taliban was seeking to diversify Afghanistan’s foreign ties.\n\n“Thirdly, India may also feel it can engage more overtly with the Taliban now. The Trump 2.0 administration could soon choose to take a more transactional view to diplomatic ties with Kabul, in contradiction to the Biden administration’s more values-driven approach,” Levesques said.\nPakistan’s relationship with the Taliban has deteriorated since its takeover of Afghanistan, with Islamabad accusing Kabul of rising “cross-border terrorism”. Relations soured further last year when Pakistan imposed trade restrictions, expelled 500,000 undocumented Afghan migrants, and tightened visa policies at border crossings.\nFormer Indian diplomat Ajay Bisaria said that the delegation’s visit was a continuation of a pragmatic approach taken by New Delhi in its dealings with the Taliban.\n“India’s central concern was that the territory of Afghanistan should not be used for terrorism against India. Secondly, India wants to preserve its long-term goodwill in Afghanistan,” Bisaria said.\nIndia has not recognised the Taliban government due to multiple concerns and its intention to align with the global community’s position regarding the rulers in Kabul, he added.\nOn Tuesday, the Taliban appointed Ikramuddin Kamil, an alumnus of the South Asian University in Delhi, as its acting consul in Mumbai – its first appointment of an India-based official since taking power in 2021.\n\nBisaria said having cordial relations with Afghanistan was in India’s interest and the consul’s appointment was a positive step.\n“This is a practical approach [by India of] not recognising [the Taliban government] while at the same time not rejecting the reality of that regime. And Pakistan is not the factor in this, whether Islamabad likes it or not,” he said.\n“It is important for India to preserve its interest in the region. The Chahbahar port bypasses Pakistan and can be used to provide Indian goods to Afghanistan so it is in the interest of Taliban and the Afghan people only,” he said.\nIndia has been sending significant amounts of wheat to Afghanistan via the Chahbahar port as part of its US$3 billion development aid provided to Kabul.\nKulbhushan Warikoo, a retired professor of Central Asian Studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, said the financial package was significant in the context of the two countries’ “mutual outreach”.\n“India has been consistently helping Afghanistan with humanitarian assistance ... It is a huge investment given India itself is a poor country,” Warikoo said.",

                                    "content": "India’s recent move to expand its engagement with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan reflects pragmatic diplomacy driven by strategic and security interests. More than three years after the Taliban took control of the war-torn nation, there is a growing realisation that India must recalibrate its position and figure out a working relationship with the new rulers. However, the ultra-orthodox regime is not officially recognised. New Delhi has a major stake in the stability of Afghanistan and has invested considerable resources in the country’s development and in extending humanitarian assistance to its people. For a long time, India was concerned about the Taliban’s links with Pakistan’s ISI and efforts by the latter to use the Haqqani network to target India’s interests in Afghanistan. However, the situation has changed now, in the wake of the worsening Afghan-Pakistan bilateral relations. The Pakistani terror groups no longer have uncontrolled access to Afghan territory. Though there are still some isolated reports of movement of some terrorists, weapons and equipment left over by the Americans from Afghanistan into Jammu & Kashmir and Punjab via Pakistan, India will have better chances of neutralising these factors with improved relations with the Taliban regime. Expanding its footprint in the country would also enable India to complete over 500 projects it had taken up in the past in road construction, drinking water supply and expanding medical facilities. The Taliban, on its part, see New Delhi as a major stakeholder which can play a key role in facilitating long-term peace and stability in their country.\r\n\r\nIn recent times, India has made some well-calibrated changes in its policy. It allowed the Taliban to take de facto control of its diplomatic missions in India in November 2023. Earlier this month, a senior official of India’s External Affairs Ministry met Taliban Defence Minister Mohammad Yaqub Mujahid and Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul to discuss ways to expand bilateral relations and accelerate the delivery of humanitarian assistance using the Chabahar port, now being operated by an Indian company. India is also considering the request of the Taliban government to appoint a Second Secretary Ikramuddin Kamil in its Consulate in Mumbai. In June 2022, India sent considerable aid to the Afghans when the earthquake wreaked havoc, becoming one of the first countries in the region to respond. India’s decision to do business with the Taliban was also motivated by China restoring diplomatic ties with Kabul. During meetings with Indian officials, Taliban ministers have expressed interest in stronger bilateral political and economic ties and easier visas for Afghan businessmen to travel to India. They are also keen to reduce their dependence on Pakistan for economic, transport and other assistance. Its Deputy PM for Economic Affairs, Mullah Baradar, visited the Chabahar port in November 2023 and expressed interest in boosting trade with India via this port.",

They emphasized the crucial role of neighboring nations in ensuring a peaceful and stable Afghanistan,\" according to the FO's brief statement. According to sources, Pakistan briefed the Chinese envoy on the present situation in Afghanistan, including how terrorist groups such as TTP and others continue to use the neighboring country's territory. \n\nAccording to sources, authorities in Islamabad provided compelling proof to the Chinese diplomat regarding terrorist sanctuaries across the border that pose a threat to Pakistan's security.The Chinese envoy was informed that, despite repeated calls from Pakistan and the international community, the Afghan Taliban were not doing enough to curtail their actions. Pakistani officials urged the Chinese envoy that it was necessary to take a united stance against the Afghan Taliban to persuade them to keep the promises they made to the international community.China has previously attempted to arbitrate between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban administration on the issue of TTP, but earlier attempts have failed to yield results. \n\nThe main reason was that the interim Taliban government refused to use force to remove TTP terrorists from its territory.Pakistan believes China still has influence over the Taliban and may pressure Kabul to address Islamabad's concerns.Since the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in August 2021, Pakistan has seen an increase in terrorist strikes. Islamabad was initially overjoyed with the Taliban's return because it believed they would not allow Afghan soil to be used against Pakistan. However, contrary to expectations, the TTP and other terrorist groups were merely emboldened during Taliban control. \n\nThe Afghan Taliban's failure to act against the TTP has harmed the bilateral relationship to the point where the two countries now retain minimal contact.Pakistan has made it clear that any development in bilateral collaboration is dependent on the Taliban taking serious and verifiable action against terrorist sanctuaries.",

This year at least 7 Chinese nationals were killed in two different terrorist attacks.\n\nPakistan’s investigations into the March 26 Besham terrorist attack concluded that there was a network connected to TTP was behind the attack. The probe also revealed that the suicide bomber was an Afghan national and the vehicle used in the attack was smuggled into Pakistan.\n\nSimilarly, Pakistan believes Baloch terrorist groups are now closely working with the TTP and also have their training camps in Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, unlike other countries, China usually follows a carefully crafted policy where such concerns are conveyed from behind closed doors.\n\nOfficials here believe that they have this understanding that the Chinese envoy forcefully raised the issue of terrorist sanctuaries with the Afghan leadership.\n\nA statement issued by the Afghan Deputy Prime Minister’s Office indicated that Pakistan, and Afghanistan relationship was one of the subjects of discussions.\n\nAccording to the statement, Mr Yue Xiaoyong commended Afghanistan’s progress over the past three years and stressed the significance of fostering improved relations and mutual understanding among Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China.\n\nThe reference to Pakistan, Afghanistan and China, according to observers, shows that Beijing is keen to see issues between Islamabad and Kabul are sorted out.\n\nThe Afghan deputy prime minister told the Chinese envoy that the Islamic Emirate has consistently guaranteed its neighbours and the international community that Afghanistan poses no threat to any nation and has upheld this assurance over the past three years.\n\n“The Deputy Prime Minister further noted that Afghanistan is transitioning from a prolonged period of conflict and is prioritizing the revitalisation of its national economy and the expansion of regional cooperation,” according to the readout, which suggests that the Afghan side tried to placate concerns of China and Pakistan.",

Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson, Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, expressed concerns about the activities of terror groups operating from sanctuaries in Afghanistan, emphasizing the need for cooperation among neighboring countries for peace and prosperity in the region. The Taliban's victory in Afghanistan has emboldened the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), leading to a surge in attacks against Pakistani forces and civilians. Pakistan's former Special Representative for Afghanistan, Asif Durrani, warned that unchecked militancy could lead to another 9/11. The Taliban, however, deny Pakistan's accusations, claiming that the majority of attacks carried out in the name of Daesh in Afghanistan were by foreign nationals. Despite the Taliban's denials, similar reservations have been expressed by other countries, including Russia, which is alarmed by the presence of non-Afghan groups in Afghanistan and the activities of Daesh-KP.",

He had also held similar meetings. As usual both sides remained tight lipped about their discussion. \n\nHowever, according to the ministry of foreign affairs, the two sides exchanged views on relations with Afghanistan and called for enhanced coordination among regional countries for a peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan and agreed to remain engaged towards this end.\n\nThese two important mid-November visits mark a significant step toward the role of neighbouring countries in promoting regional peace and stability — coming at a time when Pakistan faces a renewed wave of terrorism.\n\n“During these meetings, the two sides discussed the situation in Afghanistan, the concerns about terrorism that Pakistan continues to face from hideouts and sanctuaries inside Afghanistan; and the importance of cooperation between neighbouring countries of Afghanistan for peace, stability and prosperity in Afghanistan,” explained foreign office spokesperson in her briefing. \n\nMumtaz Zahra Baloch said, “Pakistan faces the terror groups which have sanctuaries and hideouts in Afghanistan. Pakistan is concerned about the activities of these terror groups. We are also concerned about continued freedom of operation of terror groups that have found hideouts in Afghanistan.”\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nShe didn’t elaborate if any evidence “about the support that terror groups (in Afghanistan) receive from hostile powers” was shared with the visiting dignitaries. However, Baloch gave a clear indication that Pakistan didn’t believe Afghan Taliban regime is abiding by Doha Peace Deal.\n\nIn her own words, “We hope that the Afghan authorities will consider this to be a serious threat, not just to the region, but also their own security, and fulfill their obligations under various international agreements, including the Doha Agreement.”\n\nThat agreement requires first and foremost, “guarantees to prevent the use of Afghan soil by any international terrorist groups or individuals against the security of the United States and its allies.”\n\nThe TTP connection\n\nYet, Taliban victory in Afghanistan only emboldened their ally Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to break ceasefire agreement with Pakistan in 2022. Since then, they are carrying out relentless attacks against Pakistani forces and civilians alike.\n\nPakistan’s former Special Representative for Afghanistan Asif Durrani has warned that if this militancy remains unchecked, the world can witness another 9/11.\n\nIn an interview, Durrani said, “We are witnessing daily operations by TTP and Daesh-Khorasan’s activities are well known. They have carried out attacks in Iran, Russia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Pakistan.”\n\nThe level of distrust between the two countries is only growing as Afghanistan rejects Pakistan’s narrative as “both provocative and misaligned with the ground realities.” \n\n“The Afghan government has successfully neutralised the Daesh-KP, insurgent group, within Afghanistan. However, addressing Daesh-KP hideouts along the theoretical Durand Line could lead to the complete elimination of this threat. It’s worth noting that the TTP issue is an internal matter of Pakistan, requiring a domestic solution,” remarked Afghanistan foreign office deputy spokesperson.\n\nTaliban claims that the majority of the attacks carried out in the name of Daesh in Afghanistan were by foreign nationals who had entered the country form outside.\n\nWithout naming the countries, Kabul claims, \"We take this opportunity to call on all countries in the region to cooperate in preventing the recruitment of their citizens by Daesh and then send them to Afghanistan and other countries to carry out subversive operations.\"\n\nWhile the Taliban may deny Pakistan’s accusations, similar reservations have also been expressed by other countries. In February 2024, a report presented to the United Nations Security Council indicated that the Taliban have not cut ties with foreign terrorists, including Al Qaeda.\n\nThe same report claimed that terrorists have created eight new training camps and bases for storing weapons on Afghan territory, including in the provinces of Ghazni, Laghman, Parwan, Uruzgan, and Panjshir.\n\nThe report highlighted that an Al Qaeda camp in Kunar was \"conducting suicide bomber training\" to assist TTP operations against Pakistan.\n\n\"Besides supplying weapons and equipment, Taliban rank and file, Al Qaeda core, and AQIS fighters assisted TTP forces in cross-border attacks… Some Taliban members have also joined TTP, perceiving a religious obligation to provide support,\" the report noted.\n\nThe report gains credibility as in August 2022, Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed in a US drone strike in Afghanistan.\n\nRussia's reservations\n\nRecognising the Taliban government by Russia seems even more distant. Moscow is alarmed by a number of factors, including the presence of non-Afghan groups in Afghanistan.\n\nIt is paying close attention to the activities of Daesh-KP, which has reportedly targeted the Taliban, foreign citizens, including diplomats, and has conducted overseas operations.\n\nA deadly attack on the Crocus City Hall concert venue on the outskirts of Moscow is one such example. The attack on March 22 claimed 144 lives and left 155 people injured.\n\nAccording to Russian media, within hours, four perpetrators of the terrorist incident — Delerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakram Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni, and Mukhammadsobir Faizov — were arrested in Bryansk, a region of Russia that borders Ukraine.\n\nTheir seven accomplices —brothers Amichon and Dilovar Islomovs, their father Isroil Islomov, Alisher Kasimov, Lutfullo Nazrimada, Yakubdzhoni Yusufzoda, and Mukhammad Sharipzoda — were also held.\n\nIt is claimed that Ashurov, captured on April 16, helped the Islomov brothers obtain fake documents. Five other accused in the same incident were detained in Dagestan. Four of them were members of ISKP. \n\nDirector of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), Alexander Bortnikov, said, \"We know for certain that the recruiters of the perpetrators of the terrorist attack were members of IS-K and were specially targeting the Tajik diaspora in Russia through the internet from Afghanistan.\"\n\nHence, it is not only ISKP but also extremist ideologies that perplex Russia about how Kabul wants to evolve its society.\n\nFor the Kremlin, it is strange to see Kabul banning school education for girls, imposing dress codes on students, converting educational centers into madrassas and \"jihadist centers,\" and prohibiting women from employment.\n\nThe lack of a truly inclusive government is another irritant. \n\n\"The Taliban government includes Uzbeks, Tajiks, Pashtuns, and Hazaras, but they are all politically Taliban. We are talking about ensuring not only ethno-confessional inclusivity, but also political inclusivity,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has outlined as priorities.\n\nAt the top of it, before any formal recognition, Moscow must delist the Taliban movement from the organisations it has proscribed as terrorists.\n\nAs Moscow too has limited options but to stay engaged with the Taliban, it is highly likely that Russia will change course in the coming months.\n\nCentral Asian countries\n\nMoscow may not be the first to recognise the Taliban government, but it has at least paved the way for many others to establish relations with Kabul.\n\nAddressing the sixth Moscow Format Consultation on Afghanistan, Taliban foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi admitted, \"The Russian government initiated the Moscow Format at a time when the situation in Afghanistan was uncertain and concerning. \n\n\"The Moscow Format has undoubtedly played an effective role by providing the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) with the opportunity to talk and hold discussions with influential countries in the region and beyond, even prior to Afghanistan’s independence.\"\n\nThe removal of the Taliban movement from the list of proscribed groups by two former Soviet states reflects how regional countries are encouraged to embrace the Taliban, who were long considered a pariah.\n\nKyrgyzstan, in less than a year, has followed in the footsteps of Kazakhstan in accepting the Taliban as a non-terrorist organisation.\n\nFor the globally isolated Taliban, it’s another feather in the cap.\n\n\"Aligning with the actions of other countries, the step taken by Kyrgyzstan signifies a growing political recognition of the IEA on both regional and international levels and removes a barrier to strengthening bilateral relations between the IEA and other countries,\" remarked the Taliban on the development.\n\nHigh-profile meetings are also taking place between these countries to explore ways to promote economic cooperation, bilateral trade, and transit.\n\nIn a meeting with Afghan foreign minister Muttaqi in Kabul, the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan, Abdullah Nigmatovich Aripov, “expressed his intention to upgrade diplomatic relations with Afghanistan, indicating that Uzbekistan may soon accept an ambassador of the IEA.”\n\nAfter all, both countries stand to benefit greatly from the Trans-Afghan Railway project, as it can serve as a \"critical corridor connecting Central and South Asia.\" \n\nTurkmenistan is also aggressively developing ties with Afghanistan. Both countries have inaugurated major initiatives, including the Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India Pipeline (TAPI) gas pipeline, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (TAP) power transmission, Noori Fiber Optic Network, and a railway line. \n\nFor Afghanistan, it is a successful extension of the TAPI pipeline through its territory. It also has the potential to benefit Pakistan and India.\n\nThe author is Controller News at Geo News. He posts on X at @NasimHaider2 and can be reached at [email protected]",

                                    "content": "The Pakistan government’s recent announcement regarding a comprehensive military operation in Balochistan has garnered significant attention amidst a backdrop of rising terror attacks in the country. The decision, made by the Federal Apex Committee of the National Action Plan, which includes all military services’ chiefs and the top civilian leadership, underscores a concerted effort to address the escalating threat posed by terrorist organizations operating in this strategically important province. The operation is aimed at combating groups that have been targeting civilians and foreign nationals, with a view to disrupt Pakistan’s economic progress through acts of violence orchestrated by hostile external powers. It is a response to ongoing security challenges, particularly those associated with the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other outlawed factions that have increasingly targeted Chinese nationals and Pakistani security forces. Moreover, it is essential to acknowledge that Balochistan is not the only province facing heightened insecurity. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) has also seen a surge in militant activities attributed to groups such as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates. While specifics regarding the newly announced military operation, such as whether it will incorporate ground or air strikes or target specific districts along the Iran border, have not been disclosed, there are indications that the strategy will involve coordination with China. This collaboration is particularly pertinent given China's concerns for its citizens following numerous attacks linked to Baloch militant groups. Earlier this year, reports suggested that China had urged Pakistan to undertake substantial offensive measures against these militants, reminiscent of Operation Zarb-e-Azb — a campaign that successfully neutralized TTP strongholds in tribal areas nearly a decade ago. Notably, the announcement of a new military operation in Balochistan follows previous declarations regarding Operation Azm-e-Istehkam. The announcement of Operation Azm-e-Istehkam in earlier this year triggered significant debate across Pakistan, raising questions regarding the government's intentions. In response to these concerns, government officials clarified that the operation was intended to accelerate ongoing counterterror offensives rather than introduce a new strategy. As part of the operation, the objective was reportedly to engage regional players in an effort to diminish the support base for militant groups operating outside Pakistan’s borders. This latest operation targeting Balochistan appears to align with the broader strategy being followed under Azm-e-Istehkam that emphasizes intelligence-based operations throughout the province. It is important to note that this approach will not entail a substantial deployment of troops aimed at clearing vast areas within Balochistan. Instead, it seems to focus on enhancing coordination between Pakistan and China in addressing militant threats. Balochistan has long grappled with issues related to militancy, and previous operations have failed to significantly alter this troubling trend. The province's expansive territory presents challenges for containment strategies against hit-and-run tactics, ambushes, and suicide bombings. Militants benefit from their proximity to borders with Afghanistan and Iran, utilizing hideouts across these regions that complicate any major ground offensive by Pakistani forces. As part of the operation in Balochistan, Pakistan may adopt a more assertive stance in seeking China's assistance in exerting pressure on Baloch militant sanctuaries located beyond its borders. Recent developments indicate that Pakistan has presented evidence of terrorist support originating from Afghanistan during discussions with Chinese officials. Notably, China's envoy for Afghanistan has visited Pakistan as part of these diplomatic engagements. China's involvement could signify an emerging role in assisting Pakistan with its counterterrorism efforts related specifically to Afghanistan. This collaboration aims to restore stability in Balochistan — a region critical for both the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project and China's broader Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Ultimately, while the operation in Balochistan may not represent a departure from existing anti-terror strategies on the ground, it signals a renewed commitment by Pakistani authorities to enhance military efforts coupled with regional initiatives aimed at isolating militant support networks. The effectiveness of this approach remains uncertain and will be closely monitored as developments unfold. In light of these developments, stakeholders within Pakistan’s political landscape must engage in transparent dialogue regarding operational objectives and expected outcomes. Such discussions will not only clarify governmental strategies but also foster trust among citizens who seek assurance amid rising threats from extremist elements.",

Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch made the statement during a media briefing, stressing that the Pakistani government has no ongoing negotiations with the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). She further noted that talks with the TTP would be contrary to the interests of the thousands of families affected by the group’s violence. Baloch reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to maintaining friendly relations with all neighboring countries, pointing out that strengthening ties with one country does not imply deteriorating relations with others. When questioned about Israeli remarks on Iran’s nuclear capabilities, she declined to comment, stating that Pakistan condemns the genocide in Gaza and supports Lebanon’s sovereignty, welcoming the ceasefire agreement there. The spokesperson also addressed the issue of Afghan nationals who were detained during protests, confirming that the Ministry of Interior had arrested foreign nationals, including Afghan citizens. She reiterated that foreign involvement in Pakistan’s political affairs is strictly illegal and urged all foreigners to refrain from engaging in the country’s political matters. The Ministry of Interior is expected to release details of the detained Afghan nationals. Additionally, Baloch confirmed that there are no travel restrictions on Pakistanis visiting the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and noted that the number of Pakistani prisoners in the UAE remains unclear. She also shared that agreements covering economy, connectivity, business, and customs were signed during the recent visit of Belarusian President. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is set to visit Iran on December 2-3, where discussions will focus on enhancing cooperation under the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) framework and the signing of the ECO Clean Energy Charter.",

Xi's visit to Brazil, at the invitation of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, includes attending the 19th G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro and conducting a state visit. Brazil, the largest country in South America, is known for its vast tropical regions, including the Amazon rainforest, and its diverse and inclusive culture. The two countries have a long history of friendship, with Chinese tea farmers having traveled to Brazil 200 years ago to cultivate tea. Xi noted that the genuine friendship between the Chinese and Brazilian people, like the hard work of Chinese tea farmers, sows hope and reaps joy and friendship. This year marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, a period during which the two countries have become close friends despite the vast distance separating them. Xi also pointed out that China and Brazil have extensive cooperation in various fields, including high-tech areas such as resource satellites, regional aircraft, deep-sea oil exploration, and biotechnology. China has been Brazil's largest trade partner for 15 consecutive years and is one of Brazil's main sources of foreign investment. Xi expressed China's willingness to continue enriching the contemporary connotations of the friendship between the two countries, making the Sino-Brazilian relationship a model of unity, cooperation, common development, and mutual benefit among major developing countries, contributing more to the cause of human peace and progress.",

                                    "content": "【文/蒂亚戈·诺加拉，翻译/观察者网 彭宇萱】当地时间11月20日，巴西总统卢拉将在阿尔沃拉达宫（总统府）接待中国国家主席习近平，共商中巴双边关系。鉴于今年是巴西与中华人民共和国建交50周年，也让双方此次会谈备受瞩目。卢拉政府高度重视加强与中国的合作，这无疑进一步提升了人们的期待。11月13日，巴西外交部亚太事务秘书爱德华多·萨博亚在新闻发布会上表示：“两国领导人将借此机会确认双边政治伙伴关系的提升，探索双方各自发展政策和投资项目之间的协同效应，并深化在地区和多边问题上的协调。”因此，双边伙伴关系的正式提升预计将进一步推动中巴协同效应的增强。在这一伙伴关系的历史进程中，有几个重要里程碑：1993年双方建立战略伙伴关系（中国首次签订此类协议），以及2012年将其提升为全面战略伙伴关系。自卢拉总统2004年首次访华以来，双边贸易额增长了十七倍有余。2009年，中国成为巴西第一大贸易伙伴，超越自1929年以来一直是巴西最大贸易伙伴的美国，并一直保持至今。如今，巴西已成为中国市场上最大的食品供应国，并且过去十年来一直是中国在南美洲投资的首选目的地。正如两国领导人多次强调的那样，巴西与中国的友谊历来“超越贸易互补性”。这50年来，科技、投资、教育、文化等领域的诸多项目，也见证了双边关系的不断发展。1988年启动的中巴地球资源卫星（CBERS）项目是双边科技合作的里程碑。多年来，该计划取得了显著进展，已成功发射了六颗卫星。其成功甚至通过“CBERS非洲计划”惠及非洲，使多个非洲国家得以利用卫星数据。2019年12月20日11时22分，我国在太原卫星发射中心用长征四号乙运载火箭成功发射中巴地球资源卫星04A星，此次任务同时搭载了中国应对气候变化“南南合作”项目——赠埃塞俄比亚微小卫星以及“天琴一号”技术试验卫星等8颗卫星。 新华社2004年中国-巴西高层协调与合作委员会（COSBAN）和中国-巴西商务理事会（CBBC）的成立与加强，体现了双方关系的日益深化，而卢拉总统在当前任期内更是对此给予了前所未有的重视。2023年4月卢拉总统最近一次访华期间，见证签署了15项政府间协议，并宣布了在可再生能源、汽车制造、农业综合企业、绿色信贷、信息技术、医疗健康和基础设施等领域达成的32项商业合作。自20世纪70年代以来，两国在多边场合维护共同优先事项方面展现出高度一致，共同倡导建立一个更能反映发展中国家愿望和需求的全球秩序。进入21世纪，这种一致性在共建金砖国家及其新开发银行、加强二十国集团合作、参与亚洲基础设施投资银行及其他多边组织等联合行动中体现得尤为明显。秉承这一精神，巴西与中国在国际货币基金组织份额改革中携手合作，在世贸组织中共同反对保护主义，并始终不渝地推动建立一个更加公正、平衡、多极化的全球秩序。两国还坚定支持以和平方式解决国际冲突，近期在提出采用联合措施解决乌克兰持续冲突方面发挥了重要作用。近几个月来，最重要的联合举措之一是深化电动汽车生产领域的合作，包括在巴伊亚州卡马萨里前福特生产厂的旧址上建立一个大规模的比亚迪工厂。起初，2023年预计的投资额为30亿雷亚尔（约37亿人民币）；而目前的估算显示，投资额可能会超过这一数字的两倍，有望在巴西创造超过1万个就业岗位。与此同时，巴西市场已成为全球增长最快的电动汽车市场之一。这一合作直接支持了卢拉政府两项关键目标：推动能源向清洁能源转型，以及实现国家再工业化。近几个月来，巴西领导人一再强调，任何进一步加强双边关系的举措，都必须与巴西实现再工业化的核心目标相一致。当被问及巴西是否有意加入“一带一路”倡议时，卢拉以足球比赛中的位置安排来打比方，表示虽然巴西可以加入，但不会满足于仅仅充当“替补队员”，而是要求成为“首发队员”。秉承这一思路，卢拉的外交政策特别顾问塞尔索·阿莫林于8月表示，虽然基础设施投资至关重要，但与中国合作的核心应聚焦于“技术领域的紧密合作”。他以巴西的电动汽车电池生产为例，说明在这一领域深化合作的潜力。此外，多位巴西领导人还强调，应优先考虑使用乙醇的混合动力汽车。乙醇是巴西以甘蔗为原料生产的生物燃料，与纯电动汽车相比，它在环境、成本和物流方面都具有多项优势。2023年7月4日，一名参观者（右）在巴西巴伊亚州首府萨尔瓦多拍摄一款比亚迪纯电动汽车。 新华社在卢拉之前的任期内，巴西曾努力与美国在生物燃料领域建立广泛的合作关系。巴西期望以甘蔗乙醇为媒介，实现经济发展与环境保护的双赢，同时助力周边国家的发展。与此同时，美国则寻求减少对中东等政治动荡的产油地区的依赖。然而，美国的保护主义最终破坏了这些努力，美国通过补贴和歧视性措施，阻止巴西乙醇进入其市场。这种保护主义主要是为了保护其以玉米为主的美国国内乙醇产业，该产业受到各种政府计划和补贴的支持。尽管卢拉去年通过全球生物燃料联盟与美国和印度重启了这一构想，但美国保护主义做法持续存在的可能性仍然很高，特别是在唐纳德·特朗普当选之后。这一背景进一步凸显了巴西和中国在该领域利益的契合性。巴西凭借其丰富的锂资源储备以及与“锂三角”（阿根廷、玻利维亚和智利）的地理邻近优势，有望成为西半球电动汽车和电池生产的中心。“锂三角”地区合计拥有全球近60%的已知锂矿储量，这是电动汽车行业不可或缺的关键资源。双方的共同努力将使巴西和南美洲在全球价值链中占据一个有利地位，在全球能源和技术转型中发挥核心作用。此外，这一合作可能推动拉丁美洲（特别是南美洲）与中国在基础设施、贸易以及科学技术领域更广泛的一体化进程。除墨西哥和哥伦比亚以外，中国已成为拉丁美洲几乎所有最大经济体的首要贸易伙伴。秘鲁钱凯港口的开放是一个重要里程碑，标志着拉丁美洲与中国的共同愿望日益契合。凭借经济和外交影响力，巴西正蓄势待发，有望引领与中国关系的新阶段，自然将自己定位为该地区与中国增加互动的焦点。尽管巴西与中国双边关系的深化，引发了国际社会对巴西未加入“一带一路”倡议的猜测，但这种分析往往反映了外界的偏见，而非中巴合作日益增强的现实。卢拉及其政府一直强调，与中国关系的坚实强化并不依赖于正式加入“一带一路”倡议。正如塞尔索·阿莫林在卢拉2023年4月访华期间所指出的，该倡议的精髓——多层次的全面合作——数十年前就已成为现实，这一点从双边取得的显著成就中可见一斑。同样，中国政府也已明确表示，正式加入“一带一路”倡议并非相互理解或合作富有成效的前提。中巴关系的这些特点——以全面性、团结性和不干涉内政原则为根基——持续在发展中国家中引起强烈共鸣。相比之下，美国却试图干涉拉丁美洲国家的主权决策。在“新冷战”的叙事下，美国官员一再批评中国在拉丁美洲的投资，并毫无根据地担忧其军事目的。就在上周，新任美国南方司令部司令的阿尔文·霍尔西声称，“中国和俄罗斯试图破坏民主，并试图在该地区获取权力和影响力。”同样，最近美国贸易代表戴琪也警告巴西不要加入“一带一路”倡议，并敦促巴西的“朋友们”从“风险管理”的角度来评估这一提议。2024年8月15日，在巴西首都巴西利亚，巴西副总统阿尔克明（中）在“巴西－中国：五十年友谊与合作，迈向包容与可持续发展”展览上参观。 新华社在近几个月来推动的主要联合倡议中，尤为突出的是科技合作的深化，特别是在卫星项目和太空探索方面。上周，有报道称中国卫星公司SpaceSail计划在巴西开展业务。此举将帮助中国在促进巴西获取先进卫星技术方面发挥重要作用，同时这也对自2022年起在巴西运营的埃隆·马斯克旗下SpaceX公司的卫星互联网提供商“星链”的主导地位构成挑战。“星链”主要致力于改善亚马逊偏远地区的互联网连接，常常得到包括政治人物在内的明确支持，比如2022年马斯克与巴西前总统雅伊尔·博索纳罗备受争议的会面。马斯克与美国政府的关系，包括他在特朗普政府期间的顾问角色，为卫星网络之间的竞争增添了地缘政治色彩，加剧了美国对中国在巴西影响力日益增强的批评。此类言论绝非新鲜事。中国被指控可能将5G网络用于军事用途，导致了一系列由美国主导、针对华为在拉丁美洲活动的行动。颇具讽刺意味的是，正是美国被曝出利用非法监视手段对拉丁美洲领导人进行间谍活动，这一事实在2013年爱德华·斯诺登泄露的文件中得以揭露，文件详细记录了美国国家安全局（NSA）对时任总统迪尔玛·罗塞芙及其他巴西官员的间谍活动。正值庆祝两国建交五十周年之际，巴西与中国之间的全面战略伙伴关系持续蓬勃发展绝非偶然。卢拉与习近平即将举行的会晤，预示着双方合作与团结将迈入一个更深层次的崭新阶段。金砖国家新开发银行现任行长迪尔玛·罗塞芙近期荣获中国国家主席颁发的友谊勋章，这恰是对双方协同合作日益增强的体现。同样地，巴西与中国在全球论坛如二十国集团中始终保持紧密合作，不断巩固双方对于多极世界秩序的共同愿景与承诺。去年，在人民大会堂的宏伟殿堂之下，卢拉坚定地宣布：“没有人能阻止巴西加强与中国的关系。”即将在巴西利亚举行的会晤正是这一坚定愿景的见证，预计将为这两个发展中大国的长久伙伴关系注入新的活力。本文系观察者网独家稿件，文章内容纯属作者个人观点，不代表平台观点，未经授权，不得转载，否则将追究法律责任。关注观察者网微信guanchacn，每日阅读趣味文章。",

Xi's state visit to Brasilia on Wednesday, November 20, highlights the intensifying diplomatic competition in South America, with Beijing's presence in the region and on the global stage, while the U.S. is in a presidential transition phase. According to Reuters, Xi and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva are expected to sign agreements to boost trade and cooperation across various sectors, from agriculture to energy and space. Two significant meetings, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Lima and the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, have seen major agreements with bilateral trade volumes of approximately $180 billion developed during the week Xi attended. As Xi takes the lead, U.S. President Joe Biden has offered only limited engagement. A European diplomat noted that this year, China has fostered unity on several issues, including topics like women's rights, which have not previously garnered much attention. This appears to be a new turn in the control of multilateral forums, which future U.S. President Donald Trump may also not prioritize.",

They also agreed to strengthen relations in 37 areas, including agriculture and trade. The two leaders discussed the situations in Ukraine and Gaza. President Xi visited Brasilia as a state guest after attending the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro on November 18-19. According to the Brazilian government, the two countries have upgraded their bilateral relations from a \"global strategic partnership\" to a \"community of shared destiny.\" President Lula stated that the synergy between Brazil's development strategy and the Belt and Road Initiative would be created. However, Brazil did not join the Belt and Road Initiative. Local media reported that Brazil was under pressure from China to participate. It is believed that Brazil decided not to join to avoid overly strengthening its relationship with China, which could harm its relations with the United States. Brazil traditionally pursues a multipolar foreign policy, valuing both the West and China and Russia as poles in the international community. On the other hand, President Xi emphasized that \"China and Brazil have a great historical responsibility to protect the common interests of the Global South (emerging and developing countries) and promote a fair and just international order.\" President Lula, who was president from 2003 to 2010, prioritized relations with China, and China became Brazil's largest trading partner in 2009. Since returning to the presidency in January 2023, he has continued to work to strengthen relations with China.",

The phrase \"A bosom friend afar brings a distant land near\" aptly describes the relationship between China and Brazil. Two hundred years ago, the first Chinese tea farmers crossed mountains and seas to Brazil to plant tea and impart their skills. The practical cooperation between the two countries not only covers traditional trade and economic fields but has also expanded to high-tech areas such as resource satellites, regional aircraft, deep-sea oil exploration and development, and biotechnology, truly encompassing everything from the sky to the sea. Cultural exchanges have enhanced mutual understanding and deepened the friendship between China and Brazil. If the \"Chinese Pavilion\" is a tangible reminder of past exchanges, then the \"intangible pavilion\" of the hearts of the Chinese and Brazilian people is being warmly connected in real-life scenarios.",

Let’s act gradually, step by step, but we do not intend to artificially impede the processes,\" Rudenko noted.\n\nRussia has been slowly building ties with the Islamic Emirate since it regained power in Afghanistan in August 2021 but the IEA is still officially outlawed in Russia.\n\nIn response to Russia’s comments last month, the IEA’s acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said the Islamic Emirate “appreciates the positive remarks by the high-ranking officials of the Russian Federation in this regard and hope to see more effective steps soon.\"",

During his stay in Kabul, Shoigu met with the interim government's Deputy Prime Minister for economic affairs, Abdul Ghani Baradar, to discuss political relations, economic cooperation, trade, transit, and investment. This visit, conducted under Putin's instructions, suggests an elevated status of the Afghan issue in Russia's foreign policy and a potential shift in Russia's stance towards the Taliban government. Shoigu also promised to remove the Taliban from Russia's list of terrorist organizations, a move that has been hinted at for months. Meanwhile, China's actions in Afghanistan have not been slow, with Special Envoy for Afghan Affairs Yue Xiaoyong visiting Kabul to meet with various levels of the interim government. Yue emphasized the importance of promoting Afghanistan's relations with neighboring countries and invited the interim government to participate in the fifth round of talks among foreign ministers of Afghanistan's neighbors. This visit highlights China's role in facilitating multilateral coordination and building trust on the Afghan issue. Despite Russia's delay in removing the Taliban from its terrorist list, China's approach to engaging with the Taliban has been more flexible, covering political, economic, and security interactions. This strategy has allowed China to accumulate significant experience in dealing with Afghanistan, which could serve as a reference for Russia. The visits by Shoigu and Yue Xiaoyong to Afghanistan indicate a growing diplomatic priority for both countries in addressing the Afghan issue, with a focus on long-term solutions and regional stability.",

On November 25, a Russian government delegation led by Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev visited the Afghan capital, Kabul, to meet with Taliban officials and conveyed the intention to soon remove the Taliban from the list of terrorist organizations. Both sides are facing sanctions from the West and are looking to cooperate in areas such as the economy and counter-terrorism. \"Stability in Afghanistan is important for the prosperity and promotion of economic cooperation in the region,\" Patrushev emphasized during talks with Taliban Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani. The Russian government has designated the Taliban as a terrorist organization since 2003, but Patrushev stated that the Taliban is \"in the final stages of being removed from the list.\" Both sides agreed to deepen cooperation in areas such as trade, resource extraction, and infrastructure development. Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August 2021, no country has officially recognized the Taliban regime. Russia has not recognized the Taliban regime either, but it has established a certain level of relationship, including accepting Taliban diplomats. In October, Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow. For Afghanistan, which is suffering from an economic crisis, strengthening relations with non-Western countries is essential. Reuters reported in May that Taliban Commerce Minister Abdul Bari Azizi had agreed with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to build a logistics hub in Herat, western Afghanistan, with the aim of exporting Russian oil. The Taliban is also eager to promote plans to build a natural gas pipeline connecting Central Asia and South Asia through Afghanistan. Both sides are also aligned in their desire to curb the activities of the extremist group \"Islamic State.\"",

Baradar noted the challenges posed by asset freezes and travel bans against Taliban officials, urging Russia to help mitigate the negative impact of these measures on Afghanistan's economic growth.\n\nShoigu also pointed to potential economic cooperation between Russia and Afghanistan, particularly in the fields of mineral extraction and infrastructure development. He highlighted a proposed trans-Afghan railway project, with Russia expressing interest in helping to modernize Afghanistan's transportation network.\n\nRussia's involvement in Afghanistan dates back to the Soviet Union era, which saw Soviet troops stationed in the country during the 1980s in support of the pro-Soviet Afghan government. While that conflict resulted in significant casualties for the Soviet Union, Russia remains keen on bolstering ties with Afghanistan, especially given the shifting geopolitical landscape following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAs part of this diplomatic shift, Moscow has indicated its willingness to engage more deeply with non-Western nations, a pivot prompted by the economic sanctions imposed on Russia due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Shoigu's visit underscores Moscow's broader strategy to strengthen relationships in Asia and beyond, amidst ongoing tensions with the U.S. and its European allies.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry recently announced its intention to remove the Taliban from its list of terrorist organizations, a move which would further normalize relations between the two countries. However, the legal procedures for this decision are still underway.\n\nRussia’s outreach to Afghanistan signals an intent to assert its influence in the region, as it seeks to provide political and economic support while positioning itself as a key player in Afghanistan's recovery and development.\n\nFollow Daryo's official Instagram and Twitter pages to keep current on world news.",

On the same day, Xiao published an article titled \"A Long-term Perspective for Mutual Progress\" on the website of Israel's largest Hebrew-language newspaper, \"Israel Today.\" In the article, Xiao stated that China and Israel, located at opposite ends of Asia, have maintained a healthy and stable relationship for over 30 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, achieving fruitful results in various fields of friendly exchanges and cooperation. This is attributed to the traditional friendship passed down through generations, the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and the spirit of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China is advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through Chinese-style modernization, following the strategic deployment made at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, further comprehensively deepening reforms, promoting high-level opening up, and achieving high-quality development. China's new development will provide new opportunities for countries around the world, including Israel, and open up broader prospects for Sino-Israeli relations. As a common friend of countries in the Middle East, China sincerely hopes that the current conflicts will soon cease, and that Israel and Palestine can coexist peacefully, and that the Jewish and Arab nations can live in harmony. China will continue to play a constructive role in achieving peace between Palestine and Israel and regional peace and stability. Xiao emphasized that the Sino-Israeli friendship has deep roots, and the two countries have complementary advantages in cooperation, with a broad and resilient future. As long as both sides are confident and work together, and view and promote the development of bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, Sino-Israeli relations will certainly usher in a brighter future. \"A small stream, though narrow, can eventually become a river; a small flame, though weak, can eventually turn into a raging fire.\" I am willing to closely communicate, engage in sincere exchanges, enhance mutual trust, and promote cooperation with friends from all sectors in Israel, jointly advancing the steady and far-reaching development of Sino-Israeli relations, and continuously opening up new situations. Xiao is the tenth Chinese ambassador to Israel. Upon arrival, the main diplomatic officials of the embassy welcomed him at the airport. Shagri, the Director-General of the Asia-Pacific Bureau of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who was returning to Israel after a visit to China, represented the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs in welcoming the ambassador to his new post, expressing that the Israeli side is willing to work together with the Chinese side to achieve more results in Sino-Israeli relations.",

The delegation is expected to have an observer status, as the Taliban government is not recognized by any state. Afghanistan, one of the countries most affected by climate change, has been urging the international community to continue suspended environmental projects in the country. The country's National Environmental Protection Agency (Nepa) has warned against politicizing the fight against climate change and environmental destruction. Aserbaidschan, the host country of the two-week World Climate Conference (COP29), reopened its embassy in Kabul in February, but this did not imply official recognition of the Taliban government. Afghanistan is a signatory to the Paris Climate Agreement and, despite emitting little greenhouse gases, is heavily impacted by the effects of global warming.

Es gab jedoch Hinweise darauf, dass sie lediglich einen Beobachterstatus haben wird. Die Taliban-Regierung, die im Sommer 2021 die Macht in Afghanistan übernommen hatte, wird von keinem Staat anerkannt.\n\nBei den UNO-Klimakonferenzen im ägyptischen Sharm el-Sheikh 2022 und in Dubai 2023 hatte Afghanistan sich vergeblich um eine Teilnahme bemüht. Die Nationale Umweltschutzbehörde des Landes (Nepa) hat immer wieder davor gewarnt, den Kampf gegen Klimawandel und Umweltzerstörung zu politisieren, und das Ausland dazu aufgerufen, ausgesetzte Umweltprojekte in Afghanistan fortzusetzen. Das nach vielen Kriegsjahren verarmte Land am Hindukusch zählt zu den am stärksten vom Klimawandel betroffenen Ländern der Erde.\n\nAserbaidschan, das Gastgeberland der zweiwöchigen Weltklimakonferenz (COP29), hatte im Februar seine Botschaft in Kabul wieder geöffnet.

Afghanistan has previously attempted to participate in UN climate conferences in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2022 and Dubai in 2023 but was unsuccessful. The National Environmental Protection Agency (Nepa) of Afghanistan has repeatedly warned against politicizing the fight against climate change and environmental destruction and has called on foreign countries to resume suspended environmental projects in Afghanistan.

Aserbaidschan, the host country of the two-week World Climate Conference (COP29), reopened its embassy in Kabul in February, but this did not lead to an official recognition of the Taliban government. Afghanistan is a signatory to the Paris Climate Agreement. Since the country produces little greenhouse gases but suffers greatly from the effects of global warming, Nepa chief Mawlawi Matiul Hak Chalis claims that his country should be compensated by richer states for climate-related damages.",

Welchen Status die Delegation haben wird, war zunächst unklar. Es gab jedoch Hinweise darauf, dass sie lediglich einen Beobachterstatus haben wird. Die Taliban-Regierung, die im Sommer 2021 die Macht in Afghanistan übernommen hatte, wird von keinem Staat anerkannt.\n\nBei den UN-Klimakonferenzen im ägyptischen Scharm el-Scheich 2022 und in Dubai 2023 hatte Afghanistan sich vergeblich um eine Teilnahme bemüht. Die Nationale Umweltschutzbehörde des Landes (Nepa) hat immer wieder davor gewarnt, den Kampf gegen Klimawandel und Umweltzerstörung zu politisieren, und das Ausland dazu aufgerufen, ausgesetzte Umweltprojekte in Afghanistan fortzusetzen. Das nach vielen Kriegsjahren verarmte Land am Hindukusch zählt zu den am stärksten vom Klimawandel betroffenen Ländern der Erde.\n\nAserbaidschan, das Gastgeberland der zweiwöchigen Weltklimakonferenz (COP29), hatte im Februar seine Botschaft in Kabul wieder geöffnet. Eine offizielle Anerkennung der Taliban-Regierung ging damit allerdings nicht einher. Wie fast alle anderen Staaten der Erde ist auch Afghanistan dem Pariser Klimaabkommen beigetreten.

Contact your elected officials in Washington and urge them to pave the way for safe passage for these brave men and women so that we can continue to honor our promise to them, writes guest columnist Howard Manuel, who obtained his law degree from Cleveland State University’s College of Law and is now a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer who serves on the Board of Directors for No One Left Behind.

                                    "content": "In the shadow of the Afghan mountains, a man sits in a small, windowless room. This is how he has lived for the past three years, since 2021, when U.S. troops withdrew and the Taliban reclaimed control of Afghanistan. Once, he was an interpreter for NATO forces, navigating the complexities of language, culture, and combat to support the mission. His work saved lives, helping countless U.S. soldiers avoid ambushes and giving them the ability to communicate with local leaders. But today, he lives as a hunted man under a false identity, unable to step outside without risking his life.\n\nHe listens to the footsteps outside his door daily, fearing who might be coming for him. He never stays in one place for long. When the risk becomes too great every few months, he moves to a different part of the country, blending into the shadows and erasing any trace of his past. His family cannot contact him directly, and he hasn’t seen his children in years. To the Taliban, he is a traitor — a man who worked alongside the foreign invaders and deserving of the ultimate punishment.\n\nHis story is not unique. Since the U.S. withdrawal, thousands of Afghans who served as interpreters or supported NATO forces have been living in this same constant fear, moving from safe house to safe house, hoping that one day they will be able to escape. They burn documents, erase phone numbers, and delete photos that could link them to their service. They no longer speak of their work except in trusted confidants’ hushed tones. The Taliban’s retribution is swift and brutal, and for these men and women, one wrong move could bring immediate death.\n\nSome have tried to flee the country, taking perilous journeys across borders to Pakistan or Iran, only to find themselves stuck in limbo, unable to secure passage to safety. Others remain in Afghanistan, waiting for the day when their Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applications will finally be approved. But that day may never come. Bureaucratic delays and a lack of resources have left many in limbo, their applications pending for years. They live in constant uncertainty, knowing that at any moment, the Taliban could discover their true identities.\n\nLife under Taliban rule has stripped these former allies of everything they once had — freedom, safety, and hope for a future. They are forced to remain invisible, pretending to be someone they are not, to survive. Their sacrifices during the war have been forgotten by many, but the danger they face is ever-present. For them, the war has not ended. It continues daily in the quiet terror of hiding and the isolation of exile within their own country.\n\nIn the haze of our domestic issues and following an emotional and divisive presidential election, we must remember these individuals and our promises to them. They stood by us when we needed them, risking their lives to help U.S. and NATO forces navigate a foreign land. Now, it is our turn to stand by them. We cannot allow them to be forgotten, left to face the wrath of the Taliban alone.\n\nAs individuals, we can make a difference. Contact your elected officials in Washington and urge them to pave the way for safe passage for these brave men and women so that we can continue to honor our promise to them. Their fight for survival is far from over, and they need our help. Now, more than ever, we must honor our commitments and stand by those who stood by us.\n\nHoward Manuel, who obtained his law degree from Cleveland State University’s College of Law, is a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer.

                                    "content": "8am: The visit of a senior Indian diplomat to Kabul and his meeting with Taliban officials—described by Indian media as a “significant development”—has reignited discussions about New Delhi’s role in Afghanistan’s politics. Although India did not sever all relations with the Taliban upon their rise to power, it has kept them at a level that can hardly be described as ideal. With the fall of the Afghan republic, the general perception was that India had lost the game in favor of Pakistan. This perception didn’t seem entirely unrealistic in the early days of the Taliban’s rule. Pakistan’s ISI openly acted as a power broker, resolving the deadlock in the Taliban’s cabinet formation, allowing the Pakistani military to flaunt its influence over India more than ever. But as time passed, it became clear that Islamabad had viewed the situation overly optimistically. The belief that Pakistan’s military had won both the political and military game in Afghanistan proved mistaken, as New Delhi was unlikely to easily abandon the scene. Gradually, Taliban officials openly expressed their desire to improve relations with India, and India’s embassy in Kabul resumed its operations.

Notably, the South Asian Telecommunication Regulators’ Council, the three-day event organised by the Asia Pacific Telecommunity (APT), includes a delegation from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, a significant inclusion. \n\nThe Afghan officials present at the annual council declined to answer questions, but provided their names: Saed Baraat Shah Agha Nadeem, the chairman of the Afghanistan Telecom Regulatory Authority (ATRA), Sebghatullah Andar, the Telecommunication Monitoring and Control Director, and Rohullah Raihan, a protocol director. There was also a Pakistani delegation; the country’s delegation was led by Khawar Siddique Khokhar, Member (Compliance & Enforcement) at the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). \n\nAt the plenary session, TRAI chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti was voted the chair of SATRC for the coming year, a customary appointment as India hosted this year’s session. “It is important that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) policies are increasingly related to development objectives,” Mr. Lahoti said in remarks after being voted chair. He brought up spam as an issue on which countries would have to collaborate to address. “This is not a political forum, this is a sectoral gathering,” he told The Hindu when asked about the significance of the countries in attendance. “We are fortunate that all the eight member countries of the SATRC are present here.“\n\n“We need to work harder and more patiently than ever to build our region,” Mr. Nadeem of ATRA said at his remarks in the plenary session, in which he also highlighted the importance of regional and sub-regional cooperation in telecommunications, and thanked India for its hospitality. Iran also participated with a representative present; however, the gathering was addressed by the country virtually by Alireza Darvishi, an official at the country’s Communications Regulatory Authority.\n\nLast week, J.P. Singh, joint secretary at the Ministry of External Affairs’ Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran division met with Afghan officials and discussed issues like Afghan businesses accessing the Chabahar Port, and humanitarian assistance. Afghan state-associated media reported this week that the country’s consulate would begin issuing passports to citizens in India.\n\n“South Asia faces unique challenges regarding access and inclusion, cybersecurity, spectrum management, smart cities and societies, e-waste and the regulation of social media and OTT platforms, etc,” Mr. Khokhar of Pakistan said in his remarks. \n\nThe other countries who participated were Sri Lanka, Bhutan, the Maldives and Nepal. “Post-pandemic, online platforms have taken the forefront of teaching and learning,” Bhutan InfoComm and Media Authority Director Jigme Wangdi said. “Therefore, demand for fixed broadband, ADSL, leased line, has increased, and our telecom companies are struggling to meet the demand. The universal service funds are depleting, and we still have villages to cover with usable internet connectivity. With 5G we’re in a better position to deal with the increased demand of leased lines and home broadband…” \n\nIlyas Ahmed, chief executive of the Communication Authority of Maldives, said that the archipelago nation had made progress in its broadband rollout, adding that it had become “the first country in the region” to roll out SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet services. Mr. Ahmed also brought up the issue of spam, saying it was important to “educate our citizens on spam techniques” and “make sure scammers cannot easily operate across borders.”",

Part of the VAC mandate is “to support the well-being of veterans and their families.” But the process is a hopelessly difficult labyrinth that often leads to frustration and anger. Many veterans just give up, leading to a further sense of abandonment.\n\nMost troubling is the so-called “war service” category that provides enhanced benefits for those who served in a time of war. According to its own statistics, in 2022 (the most recent available), VAC had 171,771 unique open files, which include veterans and their surviving families. Only 5,880 veterans and 30,441 family members qualified for “war service” benefits — all of them veterans who served in the Second World War and Korea or their survivors. Their numbers have certainly dwindled since then.\n\nThe families of the dead, the injured soldiers and all who served in Bosnia, Kuwait and Afghanistan do not qualify for these benefits. Were these not wars? Are their sacrifices worth less than those of previous generations?\n\nThe Royal Canadian Legion, among other groups, has lobbied for years on behalf of all veterans. We urge you to write to your member of Parliament and let our leaders know that Canada owes all our veterans the same benefits accorded to those who fought in the World Wars and Korea, and that we, as a country, do indeed owe them a “duty of care.”\n\nThis Remembrance Day we once again pause to honour and remember all those who served and sacrificed on our behalf. Let us not forget them for the rest of the year.\n\nMartin Bruyère is president of the General Vanier Branch 234 of the Royal Canadian Legion in Roxboro.",

The Afghan media reported Monday that deputy foreign minister Mohammed Stanikzai had announced appointment of Ikramuddin Kamil as acting consul in Mumbai. According to the report, Kamil is in Mumbai, where he is fulfilling his duties as a diplomat representing the ‘Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan’. There was no response from the Indian side till the evening, although govt sources said it shouldn’t be seen as a step towards recognition of the Taliban govt. In May 2023, Taliban tried to appoint a chargé d’affaires to head Afghanistan embassy here. His appointment, however, was thwarted by then Afghanistan ambassador Farid Mamundzay, who had been appointed by previous Ghani administration. Mamundzay and others are no longer in charge of Afghan missions.Jamil holds a PhD in international law and previously served as the deputy director in dept of security cooperation and border affairs in foreign ministry, the report said.In May, Zakia Wardak, the senior-most Afghan diplomat in India, resigned from her position after reports emerged that she was caught at the Mumbai airport for allegedly trying to smuggle 25 kg of gold worth Rs 18.6 crore from Dubai. India, like rest of international community, has not recognised Taliban govt, but also hasn’t allowed antipathy of past to come in way of cooperation with ‘Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan’. India continues to run its embassy in Kabul and has also regularly dispatched relief assistance.",

                                    "content": "Afghanistan embassies in Britain and Norway loyal to the pro-Western authorities ousted by the Taliban in 2021 discreetly shut down this autumn, as the West seeks a more pragmatic approach to the country's Islamic rulers.The embassy of Afghanistan in London closed on September 27, following the mission in Oslo which shut down on September 12.Both were run by staff loyal to the former authorities of the country, who were ejected from Kabul in the Taliban's lightning offensive in August 2021, a defeat seen as one of the biggest military debacles for the West.And now a senior Taliban official is even attending the COP29 UN climate talks which began on Monday, joining world leaders and top Western officials at the conference in Baku.Analysts say such moves represent acceptance of the de-facto political reality in Afghanistan and the need to work with its rulers on issues including migration, the fight against drugs, and security.Embassies like those in London and Oslo, in something of a diplomatic quirk, had carried on their work after the Taliban takeover, issuing visas and carrying out other consular work in the name of the Afghan state.But this summer the Taliban government announced that it \"no longer took responsibility\" for such passports and visas, adding that it had cut all ties with these embassies.In mid-September, the Taliban government's foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi also accused them of \"enormous corruption\" and issuing \"false documents\" with increased prices, allegations denied by several officials of the former missions contacted by AFP.With the notable exceptions of Britain and Norway, most Western governments, which still do not recognise Taliban rule, did not budge.\"Norway acknowledges that it is the authorities who de facto control the state apparatus in Afghanistan and who, according to international law, can recall personnel from Afghan missions abroad,\" the Norwegian foreign ministry told AFP.Afghan ambassador to the UK Zalmai Rassoul said on social media in September the embassy would close \"at the official request of the host country.\"\"This decision was not made by the UK government,\" a spokesperson for the UK foreign office said.\"The state of Afghanistan decided to close the Afghan embassy in London and dismiss its staff.\"London acknowledges that there is \"no alternative to engaging pragmatically with the current administration of Afghanistan,\" added the spokesperson.But the move by London was still surprising, coming from the country which after the US formed the second-largest contingent of the NATO coalition that drove the Taliban from power at the end of 2001 in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.In 20 years of deployment, 457 British soldiers were killed in Afghanistan. Ten soldiers from Norway, also a member of this coalition, were killed.\"The word we use is betrayal,\" said Nazifullah Salarzai, president of an association representing Afghan ambassadors who worked for the former authorities.\"We have been betrayed by some of our partners in the international community, I'm not shying away from this.\"But a European diplomat, who previously worked in Kabul, said a change in strategy by the West towards the Taliban authorities was necessary.\"Confrontation led nowhere,\" said the diplomat, asking not to be named, adding that the only outcome had been a \"deterioration\" of relations accompanied by a severe erosion of rights of Afghan women.Western countries are forming de-facto relations with the Taliban, regarding the group as \"a security actor\" against the Islamic State (IS) branch in Afghanistan and preventing the country from \"becoming a source of insecurity, a kind of threat,\" said a former Afghan security official who has taken refuge in Europe, asking not to be named.Afghans opposed to the Taliban fear that Germany, where more than 500,000 Afghans live, will follow in the footsteps of London and Oslo.\"The federal government has so far made no changes to the status of Afghan representations in Germany\" and does not consider the Taliban regime to be \"legitimate\", a German diplomatic source told AFP, asking not to be named.But Berlin negotiated with the Taliban, with Qatar acting as an intermediary, to allow the expulsion of 28 Afghan convicts from Germany to their country of origin at the end of August, according to Der Spiegel.Such expulsions could continue in the future via Uzbekistan, a country neighbouring Afghanistan that signed a migration agreement with Germany in mid-September, press reports have indicated.Meanwhile, Matiul Haq Khalis, director general of Afghanistan's National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), told AFP in Baku his team was invited to attend the UN climate talks by Azerbaijani authorities.The Afghan delegation is in Baku as \"guests\" of the hosts, not as a party directly involved in the negotiations.\"When you lose wars, you only have bad solutions,\" said Gilles Dorronsoro, an expert on Afghanistan.\"The decision of London and Oslo is a gift for the Taliban but also based on reality,\" he added. \"There is no alternative to the Taliban regime.\"",

The move follows \"political considerations and restrictions of the host country,\" according to an official statement from the consulate in Bonn. The Berlin embassy also cited political reasons. The Afghan embassy in Berlin and the consulate in Bonn are not under the control of the Taliban, who took power in Afghanistan in August 2021. However, they continued to operate after the Taliban's takeover. The political developments in the country since then have \"presented unique challenges to Afghan diplomatic missions worldwide,\" according to the statement on Facebook. Despite this, they have provided \"necessary consular services on request of the Afghan diaspora and German authorities without political affiliation.\" The work was \"always guided by administrative and moral responsibility and was carried out in compliance with Afghan and German laws and regulations as well as the principles of transparency and accountability.\" The Bonn general consul, Said Lutfullah Sadat, ended his 23-year tenure last Friday, \"at the request of the Foreign Office\" and other political circumstances. He expressed gratitude to Germany for ensuring consular work despite \"complex political and diplomatic circumstances\" and thanked the Afghan community in the country, including \"academic and civil society activists as well as human rights and women's rights activists.\" In the summer, the authorities in Kabul announced that they would no longer recognize the consular services of several embassies in the West. This included the Afghan embassy in Berlin and the consulate in Bonn. The regulation was likely an attempt to gain control over the active missions abroad. So far, no country has officially recognized the Taliban government, which is internationally criticized for its severe restrictions on women's rights. Therefore, it is impossible for Kabul to send new ambassadors or representatives. According to the Foreign Office, Afghanistan still maintains a consulate in Munich. It is unclear how things will proceed there.",

Nun treten zwei Spitzen-Diplomaten in Deutschland zurück.\n\nDer afghanische Botschafter in Berlin sowie der afghanische Generalkonsul in Bonn treten zurück. Der Schritt folge aufgrund von \"politischen Erwägungen und Einschränkungen des Gastlandes\", heißt es in einer offiziellen Erklärung des Generalkonsulats in Bonn. Auch die Botschaft in Berlin sprach von politischen Gründen. \n\nDie afghanische Botschaft in Berlin und das Generalkonsulat in Bonn stehen nicht unter der Kontrolle der in Afghanistan regierenden islamistischen Taliban. Sie arbeiteten jedoch auch nach deren Machtübernahme im August 2021 weiter. Die politischen Entwicklungen im Land seitdem hätten \"die diplomatischen Vertretungen Afghanistans weltweit vor einzigartige Herausforderungen\" gestellt, heißt es in der Erklärung auf Facebook.\n\nDennoch habe man die \"die notwendigen konsularischen Dienstleistungen auf Anfrage der afghanischen Diaspora und der deutschen Behörden ohne politische Bindung bereitgestellt\". Die Arbeit erfolgte demnach \"stets von administrativer und moralischer Verantwortung geleitet und erfolgte unter Einhaltung der afghanischen und deutschen Gesetze und Vorschriften sowie der Prinzipien von Transparenz und Rechenschaftspflicht\".\n\nDer Bonner Generalkonsul Said Lutfullah Sadat beendete nach eigenen Angaben vergangenen Freitag nach 23 Jahren im Amt seinen Dienst - unter anderem \"auf Ersuchen des Auswärtigen Amtes\" sowie anderer politischer Umstände. Ausdrücklich bedankte er sich bei Deutschland dafür, dass \"trotz der komplexen politischen und diplomatischen Umstände\" die konsularische Arbeit gewährleistet worden sei. Zudem dankte er der afghanischen Gemeinschaft hierzulande, etwa \"akademischen und zivilgesellschaftlichen Aktivisten sowie den Menschenrechts- und Frauenrechtsaktivisten\".\n\nIm Sommer hatten die Machthaber in Kabul bekanntgegeben, die konsularischen Dienste zahlreicher Botschaften im Westen nicht mehr anzuerkennen. Betroffen waren davon auch die afghanische Botschaft in Berlin und das Generalkonsulat in Bonn. Hinter der Regelung stand wohl der Versuch, Kontrolle über die im Ausland aktiven Vertretungen zu erhalten. Bislang hat kein Land die Taliban-Regierung offiziell anerkannt, die international vor allem wegen ihrer massiven Beschneidung von Frauenrechten in Kritik steht. Damit ist es ausgeschlossen, dass Kabul neue Botschafter oder Vertreter entsendet.\n\nLaut Auswärtigem Amt unterhält Afghanistan noch ein Generalkonsulat in München. Wie es dort weitergeht, ist bislang unklar.",

                                    "abstract": "Afghanistan's ambassador to Germany and the general consul in Bonn have resigned, apparently under pressure from the German government. The move comes amid Germany's push for deportations to Afghanistan, which requires cooperation with the Taliban and assistance from Afghan diplomatic missions. The Taliban have not recognized documents issued by these missions, and Germany is the only country to have formally acknowledged the expanded responsibility of the consulate in Munich. The resignations follow similar closures in the UK and Norway, and are seen as a contradiction to Germany's official stance against the Taliban.",
                                    "content": "Berlin taz | Offenbar auf Drängen der Bundesregierung sind am Montag Afghanistans Botschafter in Berlin, Yama Yari, und der Generalkonsul in Bonn, Said Lutfullah Sadat, zurückgetreten. In einer Erklärung der Botschaft deutet Yari an, dass andernfalls die komplette Schließung der Einrichtungen gedroht hätte.\n Sadat schreibt in einer gesonderten Erklärung, dass er aufgrund „politischer Positionen einiger Länder, besonders der Bundesrepublik Deutschland und der Europäischen Union“ sowie „politischer Erwägungen und Beschränkungen des Gastgeberlandes“ nicht mehr seine „politische Unabhängigkeit“ wahren könne.\n\n Beide Diplomaten waren noch von der Regierung der Islamischen Republik Afghanistan eingesetzt worden, die von der Taliban im August 2021 gestürzt wurde. Die Vertreter waren bisher mit deutscher Duldung weiter unter der republikanischen Flagge ihres Landes tätig und hatten sich geweigert, mit dem neuen Regime in Kabul zu kooperieren. Das tun auch die meisten anderen afghanischen Diplomaten in westlichen Ländern nicht. Einige schlossen sich zu einem „Rat“ zusammen, in dem sie ihr Vorgehen abstimmen.\n Das Auswärtige Amt wollte sich auf Anfrage der taz zunächst nicht zu den Vorgängen äußern. Deutschland erkennt – wie alle anderen Staaten – das Islamische Emirat der Taliban nicht an. Ebenso übertrug die UN-Vollversammlung den Taliban bisher nicht Afghanistans Sitz. Weil diese aber Afghanistans Territorium kontrollieren, sprechen Berlin und UN von „De-facto-Behörden“. Afghanistans UN-Sitz nimmt weiter ein Vertreter der alten Regierung ein, der jedoch erklärte, er vertrete keine bestimmte afghanische Regierung mehr.\n Widerspruch zur offiziellen Afghanistan-Politik\n Im Juli teilten die Taliban den Gastgeberstaaten afghanischer Auslandsvertretungen mit, dass sie ab sofort nicht mehr von diesen ausgestellte Dokumente anerkennen. Die Taliban-Note nannte auch die Botschaft in Berlin und das Generalkonsulat in Bonn. Zu den fünf Ausnahmen gehört das Generalkonsulat in München.\n Ob es in der Mitteilung aus Kabul auch andere Forderungen gab, ist unklar. Deutschland war laut einem Bericht der Deutschen Welle aber das einzige Land, das darauf schriftlich reagiert habe. In einer „förmlichen Mitteilung“ habe das Auswärtige Amt akzeptiert, dass das Konsulat in München nun für ganz Deutschland zuständig sei. Bis dahin war München nur für die Bundesländer Bayern und Baden-Württemberg zuständig. Seither wird es von Af-gha-n*in-nen aus ganz Europa überlaufen.\n\n Der afghanische Exilsender Amu TV berichtete ebenfalls im September unter Berufung auf einen „hohen afghanischen Diplomaten in Europa“, die Bundesregierung habe die Botschaft in Berlin aufgefordert, die „Probleme mit den Taliban binnen weniger Wochen zu lösen“. Offenbar sollte sie die erweiterte Verantwortung des Konsulats in Münchens akzeptieren. Das tat Botschafter Yari offenbar nicht. Daraufhin, so Amu, habe das Auswärtige Amt ihn und Generalkonsul Sadat aufgefordert, ihre Positionen zu räumen.\n Im Sommer hatten bereits Afghanistans Botschaften in Großbritannien und Norwegen geschlossen. Der afghanische Botschafter in London, Zalmai Rassoul, sagte, die britische Regierung habe „Druck“ auf ihn ausgeübt, dass er zurücktrete. Das britische Außenministerium sagte, die Taliban hätten die afghanischen Diplomaten in London „entlassen“, die Schließung sei aber nicht Londons Entscheidung gewesen.\n Hintergrund des deutschen Vorgehens sind wohl die von Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz (SPD) vorangetriebenen Abschiebungen nach Afghanistan. Dafür sind konsularische Hilfe der afghanischen Vertretungen sowie Kontakte mit den Taliban notwendig. Im Oktober hatte Deutschland erstmals wieder afghanische Straftäter nach Kabul zwangsausgeflogen. Den Flug mit 28 Afghanen an Bord hatte der Golfstaat Katar vermittelt.\n Das Vorgehen der Bundesregierung steht in eklatantem Widerspruch zu ihrer offiziellen Afghanistan-Politik. Erst im September hatte sie mit über 20 Staaten angekündigt, Schritte gegen die Taliban einzuleiten, weil sie gegen die UN-Konvention zur Verhinderung von Gewalt gegen Frauen verstoßen, die auch Afghanistan unterschrieben hat.",

This lack of recognition hinders economic development and limits Afghanistan's potential as a regional corridor. Regional countries are taking steps to mitigate security challenges, with over a dozen countries maintaining diplomatic missions in Kabul. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, which recognized the Taliban in the 1990s, are currently unlikely to do so again due to ongoing security concerns. China, however, has taken a bold step by accepting the credentials of the Taliban's envoy to Beijing, reflecting its strategic interests in maintaining stability in the region and preventing terrorism. China's engagement with the Taliban includes providing humanitarian aid and supporting reconstruction efforts, while emphasizing the need for a moderate and inclusive government. The issue of women's rights, while important, is not considered a top priority by China, which focuses more on addressing poverty, hunger, refugees, and terrorism threats.",
                                    "content": "Almost three and a half years have passed since the Taliban took over Kabul, yet no country has formally recognised their government.\n\nThis status quo is hampering much-needed economic development in the war-torn country. At the same time, it is limiting Afghanistan’s potential to serve as a lucrative corridor for the region and beyond. \n\nFor several reasons, this uncertainty is neither in Kabul’s interest nor a good sign for the world at large. Yet, the United States and other NATO members seem less concerned. The regional countries, however, are taking calculated steps to mitigate the security challenges posed by this volatile atmosphere. \n\nBy offering carrots, they are making efforts to convince Kabul that changing course would be beneficial to all. The diplomatic presence of over a dozen neighbouring countries in Afghanistan is a clear reflection of this stance. \n\nAzerbaijan, China, Iran, Kazakhstan, Türkiye, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Russia, and Uzbekistan have already opened their missions, while Indian diplomats are also serving in Kabul. At the same time, several European countries are also weighing this option. The Taliban know that they have a much better bargaining position than ever. \n\n\"Opening embassies is a decision of the countries themselves. Afghanistan does not beg anyone in this matter. If they want their embassy to be active, Afghanistan has no obstacles and security is ensured. Currently, we have embassies from more than sixteen countries in Kabul, all of them are active and have no problems,\" remarked Islamic Emirate’s spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid recently. \n\nThe question is, who will take the lead in recognising the Taliban, and what minimal steps must Kabul take to end the stalemate? \n\nPakistan, Saudi Arabia, and UAE \n\nBack in the 1990s, only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates recognised the Islamic Emirate as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan. \n\nThose were different times. Despite repatriating 0.75 million refugees, Pakistan is still home to 4.4 million Afghans. Yet, it faces ‘unprovoked border firing’ and other acts of aggression that claim innocent lives. \n\nHence, it seems practically impossible for Pakistan to recognise the Taliban government at present. There is also no sign that Abu Dhabi or Riyadh is interested in being the first to do so. \n\nThis is despite the recent meeting between Saudi Ambassador to Afghanistan Faisal Bin Talaq Al-Baqmi and Afghan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul. \n\nDuring the talks, Muttaqi expressed hope that bilateral relations would be further enhanced. However, Al-Baqmi responded cautiously, stressing \"pragmatic steps towards further developing relations with Afghans.\" \n\nSimilarly, Mawlawi Badreddin Haqqani presented his credentials to UAE’s Deputy Chief Protocol Affairs Saif Abdullah Al Shamsi. However, the appointment of the new ambassador has yet to yield significant results. \n\nBadreddin is awaiting a date to present his credentials to the ruler of the United Arab Emirates. \n\nBadreddin Haqqani is not related to Sirajuddin Haqqani, one of the most powerful Taliban leaders and the current interior minister. He had earlier served in a similar position in the UAE. \n\nChina’s bold step\n\nNevertheless, Chinese President Xi Jinping, despite his security concerns, has taken a bold step in formally accepting the credentials of the Taliban’s envoy to Beijing. Since then, Asadullah Bilal Karimi has been serving in China as a symbol of realpolitik. \n\nCan China go a step further and formally recognise the Taliban? \n\nBefore answering this question, it is important to analyse why China has gone the extra mile to please the Taliban. \n\nBeijing has successfully achieved its strategic objective by delivering a blow to the separatist movement in Xinjiang. It least wants the infiltration of terrorists from Afghanistan into its region, which borders eight countries. \n\nChina is aware that post-US withdrawal, Afghanistan poses a bigger threat than at any point in recent history. In an interview, China’s special envoy for Afghanistan stressed that after 20 years of US occupation, more than 20 terrorist groups existed, while there were only one or two when NATO intervened in Afghanistan.\n\nSimilar reservations were expressed in Samarkand during the fourth meeting of Foreign Ministers of Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan, a unique initiative launched by Pakistan on September 8, 2021. \n\nEarlier, the foreign ministers of China, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan met in Islamabad, Tehran, and Tunxi to address the Afghan quagmire. \n\nHowever, the Samarkand declaration \"pointed out that all terrorist groups, namely the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Al-Qaeda, the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Jundallah, Jaish-al-Adl, Jamaat Ansarullah, and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), and other terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan continue to pose a serious threat to regional and global security.\" \n\n\"Terrorism is a primary concern for all parties. This is why China is actively participating in supporting all parties in peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan, mobilising assistance from regional and international communities, and cooperating with Afghanistan to achieve shared goals, including combating terrorism and ensuring security,\" Yue Xiaoyong explained China's stance. \n\nHence, intense engagement is key to securing border areas. \n\nSince the Taliban took over Kabul, Beijing has also provided them with $64 million in humanitarian aid and a helping hand in reconstruction. It is equally pressing for a moderate and inclusive government. \n\nYue Xiaoyong said, \"China supports achieving peace... This includes building a national political framework, forming a moderate and inclusive government, continuing humanitarian and developmental aid, enhancing security—especially cybersecurity—and working together for shared development.\" \n\nUnlike the United States and some other Western countries, China does not consider women's issues a top priority. \n\n\"The issue of women, which you mentioned, is an important topic and has received widespread attention. However, it is neither the entirety of Afghanistan’s problems nor the main or root cause. We must continue to prioritise Afghan women while also collaborating with the global community to tackle Afghanistan’s most pressing challenges, such as poverty, hunger, refugees, and terrorism threats,\" replied a Chinese diplomat to a question. \n\nAmbassador Yue had recently traveled to Pakistan as well. He held talks with Foreign Secretary Amina Baloch and Additional Secretary Ahmad Naseem Warraich. No concrete declaration was issued, but it was stressed that \"Both sides exchanged views on relations with Afghanistan and affirmed the vital role of neighboring countries for a peaceful and stable Afghanistan.\"\n\nTo be continued...",

They also condemned Israeli “attacks and violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity” of Iran. It came a day after Israel confirmed that its air attack on Iran last month hit part of Tehran’s nuclear programme while degrading its defence and missile production capabilities, and amid ongoing concerns about a further escalation of tensions in the Middle East. “The three parties believe that the continuing cycle of violence and escalation is a serious threat to the security of the region and the world, as well as to maritime security,” according to the joint statement. Mediated by China, the deal was seen as a diplomatic victory for Beijing as it seeks to position itself as a global peace broker and challenge the traditional dominance of Washington in the Middle East. On Tuesday, Riyadh and Tehran also “reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the Beijing Agreement in all its provisions and their continued endeavour to consolidate neighbourly relations between their countries”, the official Saudi Press Agency reported, citing the joint statement.",

                                    "content": "台灣總統賴清德本周六(11月30日)啟程出訪友邦太平洋島國,首站將在夏威夷過境停留。 這是賴清德自5月上任以來首次出訪。此次將訪問馬紹爾群島、圖瓦盧和帕勞等台灣的三個友邦國家,訪問期間將先後在夏威夷和關島兩地過境。 這些太平洋島國是台灣12個剩餘邦交國中僅存的太平洋盟友,其他國家在中國或援助或投資承諾的「攻勢」下轉而投向北京。中國將台灣視為其領土一部分,反對國際社會任何承認台灣或其作為主權國家的主張。 賴清德強調,這次出訪是開創「價值外交」的新時代,將與友邦以民主、和平與繁榮的價值,持續拓展合作、深化伙伴關係,「讓世界看見台灣,不僅僅是民主典範,也是促進全球和平穩定繁榮發展的關鍵力量」。並感謝美國政府秉持安全、尊嚴、舒適便利的原則, 「協助這趟行程得以順利進行」。 台灣循例部署了F-16戰鬥機升空伴飛,為搭載賴清德、政府官員及媒體(包括法新社)一行的中華航空專機護航。 在航班上,賴清德向同行人員表示感謝,並強調「共同努力拓展台灣的國際空間」。 「在接下來的七天裡,我們一定能攜手努力,讓台灣穩步、自信地走向國際舞台,」賴清德表示。 賴清德此行引發了中國的強烈反應,北京誓言要「堅決粉碎」任何尋求台灣獨立的企圖。 中國外交部發言人毛寧本周四(11月28日)在記者會上就賴清德即將出訪邦交國並過境美國一事表示,賴清德的訪問計劃是謀「獨」挑釁的行徑,並在周五(11月29日)呼籲美國「要認清賴清德和民進黨當局的『台獨』本性,慎之又慎處理台灣問題。」 台灣外交部長林佳龍本周四(11月28日)在立法院表示,總統出訪是長年以來慣例,「我們呼籲北京不要以此(台灣總統出訪)為藉口,做出過當反應,例如進行軍事演習等破壞台海和平穩定的行為」。 自1949年國共內戰結束,蔣介石的國民黨軍隊被毛澤東領導的共產黨擊敗後逃到台灣以來,台灣與中國一直處於分治狀態。 台灣長期面臨中國入侵的威脅,北京從未排除使用武力統一台灣的可能性。 中國幾乎幾乎每天都在台灣周邊部署戰鬥機、無人機和軍艦,以宣示其主權,近年來出動次數不斷增加。 台灣政府官員此前在訪問太平洋或拉丁美洲時曾在美國領土短暫停留,這一舉動往往會激怒中國,後者常以軍演作為回應。 德國馬歇爾基金會台灣-中國事務專家葛來儀(Bonnie Glaser)表示,賴清德此次太平洋之行是向各國展示「台灣的重要性」的機會。 葛來儀向法新社指出,中國總是試圖營造台灣被孤立、需要依賴中國的印象。 「當台灣總統出國訪問時,這是在提醒世界,仍有國家重視與台灣的外交關係,」她說道。「當然,賴清德過境美國也是在提醒台灣民眾,美國與台灣有著緊密的伙伴關係。」 美國是台灣最重要的支持者,也是最大的武器供應國,但華盛頓並未與台北建立正式外交關係。 賴清德出訪前,美國批准向台灣出售F-16戰鬥機和雷達系統的備用部件和通訊設備,總額達3.85億美元。 本月早些時候,台灣外交部長林佳龍在布魯塞爾會見了歐洲議會議員。 葛來儀告訴法新社,即使面臨遭到中國報復的風險,越來越多的台灣高級官員出國訪問,並受到公開接待。「越多人做就越安全。當越來越多的國家採取類似行動時(會見台灣官員、接待出訪),其他國家也會更願意這麼做。」 她還指出,國際社會越來越察覺到中國展現的咄咄逼人和強硬態度,因此一些國家願意在一定程度上對抗中國,因為他們不習慣中國的這種行為方式。 「此外,台灣在國際上的重要性也是得到認可的,尤其是在半導體芯片領域。」 © 2024年德國之聲版權聲明:本文所有內容受到著作權法保護,如無德國之聲特別授權,不得擅自使用。任何不當行為都將導致追償,並受到刑事追究。 【 本文章由德國之聲授權提供】",

                                    "content": "KABUL (TOLONews): The acting Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation and Cenk Ünal, the Turkish ambassador to Afghanistan, have discussed the activation of the Lapis Lazuli Corridor.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation in a statement quoted the Turkish ambassador as saying that efforts are underway to facilitate more convenient ground transportation between Afghanistan and Turkey.\n\nImamuddin Ahmadi, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, said about the meeting: “Recently, a meeting regarding the reopening of the Lapis Lazuli Corridor was held in Turkey. The results of that meeting must be followed up, and the groundwork for transportation through this route must be prepared.”\n\nThe trade and transit agreement for the Lapis Lazuli Corridor was signed in 2017 by representatives from Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Georgia. However, the route has yet to be utilized.\n\nThe Lapis Lazuli transit route begins at the ports of Torghundi in Herat and Aqina in Faryab, passes through the Turkmenbashi port in Turkmenistan, the city of Baku in Azerbaijan, the Tbilisi region of Georgia, and Istanbul in Turkey, eventually reaching European borders. Using the Lapis Lazuli route will reduce Afghanistan’s dependency on neighboring countries and transform it into a major transit hub in the region.\n\nMirwais Hajizada, a trader, emphasized the importance of this route: “This route should be activated now or next year, instead of waiting five or ten years. It is essential for traders to be able to export their goods, as the Lapis Lazuli route is a reliable one.” Transit and customs facilities, development of transportation infrastructure among the countries along the Lapis Lazuli Corridor, improvement of transport services in these countries, and resolving issues at water and dry ports are among the points included in the Lapis Lazuli trade and transit agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce and Investment views the Lapis Lazuli route as crucial for developing commercial and transit relations. It states that this corridor is the shortest and most cost-effective transit route for Afghanistan and Asia’s commercial goods. The chamber adds that most goods transported along this route will use railways, benefiting all regional countries.\n\nKhan Jan Alokozay, a board member of the Chamber of Commerce and Investment, said: “The importance of this route is extraordinary. It is close, and we can easily reach Europe through it.” The Lapis Lazuli project is considered one of the most important trade development initiatives for Afghanistan and the region, ensuring that Afghan goods reach Europe safely, quickly, and at reasonable costs.",

The committee, which examines the circumstances of the chaotic German evacuation from Kabul in August 2021 and the acceptance of Afghan local forces, meets every Thursday during session weeks. Public interest has been limited, partly due to new crises like the Ukraine and Middle East wars dominating headlines. The committee is nearing the end of its evidence-gathering phase, with former members of the last Merkel cabinet, including Horst Seehofer, Olaf Scholz, Angela Merkel, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, and Heiko Maas, set to be questioned. Seehofer will be asked about the last deportations to Afghanistan before the Taliban takeover and the extensive security checks insisted upon by his ministry, which slowed down the acceptance process. The committee also revealed that the state secretaries' roundtable was an informal group that did not make decisions, leading to calls for clearer decision-making pathways in security policy.",
                                    "content": "Staatssekretäre aus verschiedenen Ministerien, die sich regelmäßig zur aktuellen Lage austauschen, aber keine Entscheidungen treffen. Ein über Monate ungelöster Dauerkonflikt zwischen Innenministerium und Auswärtigem Amt. Das sind nur zwei von mehreren strukturellen Problemen, die der Afghanistan-Untersuchungsausschuss des Bundestages zutage gefördert hat. \n\nDas Gremium, das die Umstände der hektischen deutschen Evakuierung aus Kabul im August 2021 und die Aufnahme afghanischer Ortskräfte unter die Lupe nimmt, tagt in Sitzungswochen immer donnerstags. Bisher ist das öffentliche Interesse überschaubar - wohl auch weil mit dem Ukraine- und dem Nahost-Krieg neue Krisen die Schlagzeilen bestimmen. \n\nAusschuss befragt frühere Mitglieder des letzten Merkel-Kabinetts\n\nMit der Befragung von Ex-Bundesinnenminister Horst Seehofer (CSU) als Zeuge an diesem Donnerstag neigt sich die Beweisaufnahme langsam dem Ende zu. Nach Seehofer wollen die Abgeordneten, die am Ende einen Bericht mit Empfehlungen für effizientere Abläufe in Krisenlagen verfassen sollen, bis Weihnachten noch mehrere ehemalige und aktuelle Kabinettsmitglieder befragen. Dazu zählen - Stand jetzt - auch Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz (SPD), Altkanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU), die frühere Verteidigungsministerin Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (CDU) und Ex-Außenminister Heiko Maas (SPD).\n\nSeehofer wird wohl vor allem Fragen zu den von ihm forcierten letzten Abschiebungen nach Afghanistan vor der Machtübernahme durch die Taliban in Kabul beantworten müssen. Zudem wollen die Abgeordneten von dem Polit-Pensionär wissen, weshalb das von ihm damals geleitete Ministerium bei der Aufnahme von Ortskräften der Bundeswehr und ehemaligen Mitarbeiter anderer deutscher Institutionen aus Afghanistan im Sommer 2021 auf umfangreichen Sicherheitsprüfungen bestand. Das hat den Prozess der Aufnahme stark verlangsamt. \n\nAufwendige Prüfung oder rasche Aufnahme?\n\nDas Auswärtige Amt beharrte zwar bis zur letzten Minute darauf, die deutsche Botschaft in Kabul geöffnet zu halten, sprach sich aber für ein vereinfachtes Aufnahmeverfahren für Ortskräfte mit einer Visaerteilung bei Ankunft aus.\n\nIm Juni 2021 gab es eine Abfrage bei den verschiedenen Ressorts der Bundesregierung, um herauszufinden, wie viele Ortskräfte seit 2013 - diesen Zeitraum hatte Merkel festgelegt - für die verschiedenen deutschen Institutionen tätig waren und damit theoretisch für eine Aufnahme infrage kämen. Das Auswärtige Amt meldete zunächst 59 Afghanen an, das Verteidigungsministerium 1.300 Ortskräfte mit Arbeitsvertrag mit der Bundeswehr, das Entwicklungsministerium kam auf mehr als 3.500 ehemalige und aktuelle lokale Mitarbeiter. Das Innenministerium schätzte, da einige schon Zusagen erhalten hätten, sei mit maximal 70 weiteren Anträgen zu rechnen. \n\nWie ein Sprecher des Bundesinnenministeriums auf Anfrage mitteilt, hat die Bundesregierung insgesamt in den laufenden Aufnahmeverfahren aus Afghanistan die Einreise von über 36.000 gefährdeten Afghaninnen und Afghanen einschließlich ihrer Familienangehörigen ermöglicht. Im Rahmen des Bundesaufnahmeprogramms lägen derzeit für 3.082 Afghanen inklusive Angehöriger Aufnahmezusagen vor, davon seien 682 mittlerweile eingereist.\n\n„Es soll insbesondere ausgeschlossen werden, dass Personen aufgenommen werden, die eine Gefahr für die öffentliche Sicherheit und Ordnung darstellen könnten“, teilt eine Sprecherin des Innenministeriums mit. Zu diesen Prüfungen gehören ihren Angaben zufolge seit Juni 2023 auch Befragungen vor der Einreise. Nach Kenntnis der Bundesregierung habe es bisher keine Fälle gegeben, in denen Menschen aus dem Bundesaufnahmeprogramm für Afghanistan trotz Sicherheitsbedenken und Zweifeln eingereist seien. Sollten solche Bedenken auftauchen, werde die Aufnahmezusage aufgehoben, „sodass die Grundlage für eine Visumserteilung zwecks Einreise entfällt“, teilte die Sprecherin mit. \n\nDer Bundesregierung seien zudem keine Fälle bekannt, in denen Menschen, die über die Aufnahmeprogramme aus Afghanistan eingereist sind, „in Deutschland als Gefährder oder relevante Person im Bereich der Politisch Motivierten Kriminalität - Religiöse Ideologie - eingestuft wurden oder dem islamistischen Personenspektrum zugeordnet werden“, teilte die Sprecherin auf Nachfrage mit. Von einem „Gefährder“ spricht die Polizei, bei Menschen, denen sie schwere politisch motivierte Straftaten bis hin zu Terroranschlägen zutraut. Das „islamistische Personenspektrum“ ist eine Kategorie, die der Verfassungsschutz verwendet.\n\nDie Grünen und die FDP waren am 15. August 2021, als die Taliban die afghanische Hauptstadt praktisch ohne Gegenwehr einnahmen, in der Opposition. Die Grünen-Politikerin Sara Nanni fragte Miguel Berger, damals Staatssekretär im Auswärtigen Amt, in einer Sitzung des Ausschusses, welche Entscheidungen die Staatssekretäre der verschiedenen Ministerien denn in ihren Runden zu Afghanistan damals getroffen haben. Seine Antwort: „Also, es ist ja nicht so, dass das Operative einer Staatssekretärsrunde sich daraus ergibt, dass man am Ende festhält: Eins, zwei drei, sondern dass man miteinander spricht und ein gemeinsames Verständnis über eine Situation entwickelt.“ \n\nZeuge nennt Runde der Staatssekretäre „informelles Gremium“\n\nAls die FDP-Abgeordnete Ann-Veruschka Jurisch vom damaligen Staatssekretär im Entwicklungsministerium, Martin Jäger, wissen will, ob die Runde überhaupt Entscheidungen getroffen oder - bei Problemen - auf die Ministerebene gehoben hätten, antwortete dieser: „Das war kein Gremium mit einer Entscheidung, wo es Beschlussvorlagen gab.“ Auch an einen formalen Verweisungsbeschluss auf die Ministerebene könne er sich nicht erinnern. Sein Fazit: „Das war ein informelles Gremium“.\n\nAus Sicht von Jurisch sind das Erkenntnisse, die für die Schaffung eines Nationalen Sicherheitsrats sprechen, den ihre Partei schon länger fordert. „Klare Entscheidungswege und Verantwortlichkeiten in der Sicherheitspolitik sind zwingend notwendig“, sagt die FDP-Politikerin. Und: „Zeitenwende bedeutet auch aus Fehlern der Vergangenheit zu lernen.“\n\nSchon wieder organisierte Verantwortungslosigkeit? \n\nDie Analyse erinnert an einen Untersuchungsausschuss der zurückliegenden Wahlperiode. Nach dem Terroranschlag auf dem Berliner Weihnachtsmarkt 2016 wurde bekannt, dass über den späteren Attentäter Anis Amri so häufig wie über kaum einen anderen radikalen Islamisten im Gemeinsamen Terrorabwehrzentrum (GTAZ) von Bund und Ländern gesprochen wurde, allerdings, ohne dass entsprechend gehandelt worden wäre. Der abgelehnte Asylbewerber aus Tunesien verkehrte in Salafisten-Moscheen, verkaufte Drogen. Bei den Behörden war er unter mehreren Aliasnamen bekannt. \n\nDie Grünen-Innenpolitikerin Irene Mihalic bilanzierte später, nach zahlreichen Zeugenvernehmungen in einem Untersuchungsausschuss, im GTAZ habe damals „eine Art organisierte Verantwortungslosigkeit“ geherrscht. Aus Sicherheitskreisen ist zu hören, seit dem Anschlag auf dem Breitscheidplatz habe es im GTAZ einige Veränderungen gegeben - etwa eine bessere Festlegung klarer Zuständigkeiten für einzelne Fälle sowie eine engere Abstimmung operativer Maßnahmen. Auch werde bei den Sitzungen inzwischen ausführlicher Protokoll geführt.",

                                    "content": "The recent remarks by Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs of Afghanistan, have sparked significant discourse regarding the internal dynamics of the Afghan interim government.\n\nIn a statement aimed at quelling rumors of discord among the leaders of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), Stanikzai asserted that there are no disagreements among government members. However, this denial raises critical questions about the authenticity of unity within the leadership and the broader implications for Afghanistan’s political landscape.\n\nStanikzai’s declaration comes amid growing speculation about rifts within the IEA, particularly as various factions vie for influence and power. By denying these internal conflicts, he may be attempting to project an image of stability and cohesion. Nonetheless, the insistence on portraying a united front can be seen as a tactic to obscure underlying issues that could undermine governance and national stability.\n\nOne notable aspect of Stanikzai’s statement is the frequent invocation of external enemies. This narrative might serve a dual purpose. It shifts focus away from internal strife while simultaneously rallying support against perceived threats. However, this strategy raises a critical concern as if the leadership is genuinely united in purpose and vision, why do disagreements appear to be increasing? Such contradictions suggest that while external enemies may be real, they are being used as scapegoats for deeper internal challenges.\n\nAddressing Afghanistan’s myriad issues requires more than just blaming external forces; it necessitates a commitment to self-reform within the leadership.\n\nAddressing Afghanistan’s myriad issues requires more than just blaming external forces; it necessitates a commitment to self-reform within the leadership. The Afghan interim government must confront its own shortcomings rather than deflecting responsibility onto outside influences.\n\nTrue progress will only occur when the leadership acknowledges its failures and takes decisive action to rectify them. Recognizing internal failures is often more challenging than attributing problems to external factors.\n\nLeadership that avoids self-reflection risks perpetuating cycles of mismanagement and discontent. By focusing on external enemies, the IEA leadership may inadvertently avoid confronting critical issues such as governance, economic policy, and public trust. The reliance on external narratives to mask internal political struggles raises further questions about transparency and accountability within the Afghan government. Why is there a tendency to conceal genuine political challenges by invoking external threats?\n\nLeadership strength is not merely about projecting unity. It also involves embracing diversity of thought and fostering collaboration among various factions. The IEA must prioritize strengthening its leadership structures to ensure that all voices are heard and valued. This inclusive approach can help mitigate tensions and create a more resilient governance framework.\n\nThe narrative suggesting that internal conflicts stem from external forces lacks solid evidence. Reports from former officials indicate that disagreements and factionalism are prevalent among IEA leaders which points to deeper systemic issues rather than mere external interference. By failing to substantiate claims against external enemies, the government risks losing credibility both domestically and internationally.\n\nAfghanistan’s economic challenges cannot be solely attributed to external interference, they also stem from harsh domestic policies, lack of international recognition, and exclusionary practices that marginalize skilled professionals from governance roles.\n\nThese factors contribute significantly to economic instability and hinder efforts toward recovery. The failure to establish a cohesive interim government has led to increased resistance movements within Afghanistan. These developments signal not only dissatisfaction with current governance but also highlight significant internal fractures that threaten national unity.\n\nFor Afghanistan’s interim government to navigate its complex political landscape successfully, it must prioritize self-reform over scapegoating external enemies. A commitment to addressing internal conflicts transparently will be crucial in fostering stability and rebuilding public trust in governance.\n\nOnly through genuine introspection and collaborative efforts can Afghanistan hope to overcome its multifaceted challenges and work toward a more stable future. Stanikzai’s further statement is of key importance for IEA. “We have to learn from the past”, He added, “We should make the country self-reliant.”\n\nThe writer is a graduate of QAU, PhD scholar and a freelance writer and can be reached at fa7263125@gmail.com",

                                    "abstract": "Recent visits by Chinese and Russian officials to Pakistan have highlighted the growing concerns over terrorism and regional stability in Afghanistan. Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson, Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, expressed concerns about the activities of terror groups operating from sanctuaries in Afghanistan, emphasizing the need for cooperation among neighboring countries for peace and prosperity in the region. The Taliban's victory in Afghanistan has emboldened the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), leading to a surge in attacks against Pakistani forces and civilians. Pakistan's former Special Representative for Afghanistan, Asif Durrani, warned that unchecked militancy could lead to another 9/11. The Taliban, however, deny Pakistan's accusations, claiming that the majority of attacks carried out in the name of Daesh in Afghanistan were by foreign nationals. Despite the Taliban's denials, similar reservations have been expressed by other countries, including Russia, which is alarmed by the presence of non-Afghan groups in Afghanistan and the activities of Daesh-KP.",
                                    "content": "Prior to Chinese Ambassador Yue Xiaoyong, Russian President’s Special Representative on Afghanistan Zamir Kabulov paid a daylong visit to Islamabad. He had also held similar meetings. As usual both sides remained tight lipped about their discussion. \n\nHowever, according to the ministry of foreign affairs, the two sides exchanged views on relations with Afghanistan and called for enhanced coordination among regional countries for a peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan and agreed to remain engaged towards this end.\n\nThese two important mid-November visits mark a significant step toward the role of neighbouring countries in promoting regional peace and stability — coming at a time when Pakistan faces a renewed wave of terrorism.\n\n“During these meetings, the two sides discussed the situation in Afghanistan, the concerns about terrorism that Pakistan continues to face from hideouts and sanctuaries inside Afghanistan; and the importance of cooperation between neighbouring countries of Afghanistan for peace, stability and prosperity in Afghanistan,” explained foreign office spokesperson in her briefing. \n\nMumtaz Zahra Baloch said, “Pakistan faces the terror groups which have sanctuaries and hideouts in Afghanistan. Pakistan is concerned about the activities of these terror groups. We are also concerned about continued freedom of operation of terror groups that have found hideouts in Afghanistan.”\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nShe didn’t elaborate if any evidence “about the support that terror groups (in Afghanistan) receive from hostile powers” was shared with the visiting dignitaries. However, Baloch gave a clear indication that Pakistan didn’t believe Afghan Taliban regime is abiding by Doha Peace Deal.\n\nIn her own words, “We hope that the Afghan authorities will consider this to be a serious threat, not just to the region, but also their own security, and fulfill their obligations under various international agreements, including the Doha Agreement.”\n\nThat agreement requires first and foremost, “guarantees to prevent the use of Afghan soil by any international terrorist groups or individuals against the security of the United States and its allies.”\n\nThe TTP connection\n\nYet, Taliban victory in Afghanistan only emboldened their ally Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to break ceasefire agreement with Pakistan in 2022. Since then, they are carrying out relentless attacks against Pakistani forces and civilians alike.\n\nPakistan’s former Special Representative for Afghanistan Asif Durrani has warned that if this militancy remains unchecked, the world can witness another 9/11.\n\nIn an interview, Durrani said, “We are witnessing daily operations by TTP and Daesh-Khorasan’s activities are well known. They have carried out attacks in Iran, Russia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Pakistan.”\n\nThe level of distrust between the two countries is only growing as Afghanistan rejects Pakistan’s narrative as “both provocative and misaligned with the ground realities.” \n\n“The Afghan government has successfully neutralised the Daesh-KP, insurgent group, within Afghanistan. However, addressing Daesh-KP hideouts along the theoretical Durand Line could lead to the complete elimination of this threat. It’s worth noting that the TTP issue is an internal matter of Pakistan, requiring a domestic solution,” remarked Afghanistan foreign office deputy spokesperson.\n\nTaliban claims that the majority of the attacks carried out in the name of Daesh in Afghanistan were by foreign nationals who had entered the country form outside.\n\nWithout naming the countries, Kabul claims, \"We take this opportunity to call on all countries in the region to cooperate in preventing the recruitment of their citizens by Daesh and then send them to Afghanistan and other countries to carry out subversive operations.\"\n\nWhile the Taliban may deny Pakistan’s accusations, similar reservations have also been expressed by other countries. In February 2024, a report presented to the United Nations Security Council indicated that the Taliban have not cut ties with foreign terrorists, including Al Qaeda.\n\nThe same report claimed that terrorists have created eight new training camps and bases for storing weapons on Afghan territory, including in the provinces of Ghazni, Laghman, Parwan, Uruzgan, and Panjshir.\n\nThe report highlighted that an Al Qaeda camp in Kunar was \"conducting suicide bomber training\" to assist TTP operations against Pakistan.\n\n\"Besides supplying weapons and equipment, Taliban rank and file, Al Qaeda core, and AQIS fighters assisted TTP forces in cross-border attacks… Some Taliban members have also joined TTP, perceiving a religious obligation to provide support,\" the report noted.\n\nThe report gains credibility as in August 2022, Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed in a US drone strike in Afghanistan.\n\nRussia's reservations\n\nRecognising the Taliban government by Russia seems even more distant. Moscow is alarmed by a number of factors, including the presence of non-Afghan groups in Afghanistan.\n\nIt is paying close attention to the activities of Daesh-KP, which has reportedly targeted the Taliban, foreign citizens, including diplomats, and has conducted overseas operations.\n\nA deadly attack on the Crocus City Hall concert venue on the outskirts of Moscow is one such example. The attack on March 22 claimed 144 lives and left 155 people injured.\n\nAccording to Russian media, within hours, four perpetrators of the terrorist incident — Delerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakram Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni, and Mukhammadsobir Faizov — were arrested in Bryansk, a region of Russia that borders Ukraine.\n\nTheir seven accomplices —brothers Amichon and Dilovar Islomovs, their father Isroil Islomov, Alisher Kasimov, Lutfullo Nazrimada, Yakubdzhoni Yusufzoda, and Mukhammad Sharipzoda — were also held.\n\nIt is claimed that Ashurov, captured on April 16, helped the Islomov brothers obtain fake documents. Five other accused in the same incident were detained in Dagestan. Four of them were members of ISKP. \n\nDirector of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), Alexander Bortnikov, said, \"We know for certain that the recruiters of the perpetrators of the terrorist attack were members of IS-K and were specially targeting the Tajik diaspora in Russia through the internet from Afghanistan.\"\n\nHence, it is not only ISKP but also extremist ideologies that perplex Russia about how Kabul wants to evolve its society.\n\nFor the Kremlin, it is strange to see Kabul banning school education for girls, imposing dress codes on students, converting educational centers into madrassas and \"jihadist centers,\" and prohibiting women from employment.\n\nThe lack of a truly inclusive government is another irritant. \n\n\"The Taliban government includes Uzbeks, Tajiks, Pashtuns, and Hazaras, but they are all politically Taliban. We are talking about ensuring not only ethno-confessional inclusivity, but also political inclusivity,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has outlined as priorities.\n\nAt the top of it, before any formal recognition, Moscow must delist the Taliban movement from the organisations it has proscribed as terrorists.\n\nAs Moscow too has limited options but to stay engaged with the Taliban, it is highly likely that Russia will change course in the coming months.\n\nCentral Asian countries\n\nMoscow may not be the first to recognise the Taliban government, but it has at least paved the way for many others to establish relations with Kabul.\n\nAddressing the sixth Moscow Format Consultation on Afghanistan, Taliban foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi admitted, \"The Russian government initiated the Moscow Format at a time when the situation in Afghanistan was uncertain and concerning. \n\n\"The Moscow Format has undoubtedly played an effective role by providing the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) with the opportunity to talk and hold discussions with influential countries in the region and beyond, even prior to Afghanistan’s independence.\"\n\nThe removal of the Taliban movement from the list of proscribed groups by two former Soviet states reflects how regional countries are encouraged to embrace the Taliban, who were long considered a pariah.\n\nKyrgyzstan, in less than a year, has followed in the footsteps of Kazakhstan in accepting the Taliban as a non-terrorist organisation.\n\nFor the globally isolated Taliban, it’s another feather in the cap.\n\n\"Aligning with the actions of other countries, the step taken by Kyrgyzstan signifies a growing political recognition of the IEA on both regional and international levels and removes a barrier to strengthening bilateral relations between the IEA and other countries,\" remarked the Taliban on the development.\n\nHigh-profile meetings are also taking place between these countries to explore ways to promote economic cooperation, bilateral trade, and transit.\n\nIn a meeting with Afghan foreign minister Muttaqi in Kabul, the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan, Abdullah Nigmatovich Aripov, “expressed his intention to upgrade diplomatic relations with Afghanistan, indicating that Uzbekistan may soon accept an ambassador of the IEA.”\n\nAfter all, both countries stand to benefit greatly from the Trans-Afghan Railway project, as it can serve as a \"critical corridor connecting Central and South Asia.\" \n\nTurkmenistan is also aggressively developing ties with Afghanistan. Both countries have inaugurated major initiatives, including the Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India Pipeline (TAPI) gas pipeline, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (TAP) power transmission, Noori Fiber Optic Network, and a railway line. \n\nFor Afghanistan, it is a successful extension of the TAPI pipeline through its territory. It also has the potential to benefit Pakistan and India.\n\nThe author is Controller News at Geo News. He posts on X at @NasimHaider2 and can be reached at [email protected]",

He points out that internal issues within PN, such as the controversy over the \"poster boy\" or prime ministerial candidate, and the recent replacement of two Bersatu state assemblymen in Perlis, have exacerbated tensions between the two parties. Fahmi, who is also the Minister of Communications, further criticizes the opposition's performance in the lower house of parliament, stating that they have failed to address substantive issues and have not been able to propose an alternative budget for two consecutive years. He also comments on the controversy surrounding the use of bilingual signs, stating that local authorities have established regulations for the languages used in shops and premises, and that this should not be a point of contention. He emphasizes that if a sign has been in violation of these regulations, action should not be taken years later, as this could create an impression of unfair enforcement.",

                                    "abstract": "The former German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas is set to be questioned by the Bundestag's investigative committee regarding the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the failure to evacuate local forces three years ago. The Taliban's rapid takeover of Afghanistan following NATO's withdrawal in the summer of 2021 led to chaotic scenes at Kabul airport. A recent investigation by the ZEIT newspaper revealed that the dramatic situation was known early on, with the Foreign Office internally warning about the Taliban and the weak state of Afghan security forces. Despite these warnings, no evacuation of particularly endangered local forces was initiated. Christian Schweppe, an investigative reporter for ZEIT, discusses the factors that led to the missed evacuation and the responsibility of the decision-makers at the time. In light of the upcoming elections in February, the AfD is working on a new election program to broaden its voter base. With current polling at around 18%, the party is losing support, partly due to growing competition, especially from Sahra Wagenknecht's BSW party, which shares similar positions on migration and social issues. The CDU under Friedrich Merz is also pursuing a more conservative line, potentially costing the AfD more votes. To better position itself, the AfD plans to expand its profile, reducing the strong male dominance and adopting a more liberal stance on issues like abortion and same-sex partnerships. Additionally, the AfD aims to appeal to disappointed SPD voters with topics such as higher social benefits. Tilman Steffen, a political editor, analyzes the AfD's strategy in the election campaign and assesses how successful the party might be with these adjustments.",
                                    "content": "Heute wird der frühere Außenminister Heiko Maas im Untersuchungsausschuss des Bundestages befragt, der sich mit dem Vorgehen in Afghanistan und der fehlenden Evakuierung der Ortskräfte vor drei Jahren beschäftigt. Nur wenige Wochen nach dem Abzug der Nato-Truppen aus Afghanistan im Sommer 2021 übernahmen die radikalislamischen Taliban erneut die Macht in dem Land, was zu chaotischen Szenen am Kabuler Flughafen führte. Eine aktuelle Recherche der ZEIT zeigt, dass die dramatische Lage früh bekannt war. Zuvor hatte das Auswärtige Amt intern vor den Taliban und der schwachen Lage der afghanischen Sicherheitskräfte im Land gewarnt. Am 23. Juni 2021 erhielt Heiko Maas ein internes Dokument, das auf die steigenden Risiken einer Taliban-Übernahme hinwies. Trotz dieser Warnungen wurde keine Evakuierung der besonders gefährdeten Ortskräfte eingeleitet. Christian Schweppe , investigativer Reporter der ZEIT, war an der Recherche beteiligt. Im Podcast ordnet er ein, welche Faktoren zur versäumten Evakuierung führten und welche Verantwortung die damaligen Entscheidungsträger heute tragen. Angesichts der Neuwahlen im Februar arbeitet die AfD an einem neuen Wahlprogramm , um ihre Wählerschaft zu erweitern. Mit aktuellen Umfragewerten von rund 18 Prozent verliert die Partei an Unterstützung. Ein möglicher Grund dafür ist die wachsende Konkurrenz, insbesondere durch die von Sahra Wagenknecht gegründete Partei BSW , die ähnliche Positionen zu Migration und sozialen Themen vertritt. Auch die CDU unter Friedrich Merz verfolgt eine zunehmend konservative Linie, was der AfD weitere Stimmen kosten könnte. Um sich besser zu positionieren, plant die AfD, ihr Profil zu erweitern. Geplant ist, die bisher starke Männerdominanz zu reduzieren und eine liberalere Haltung zu Themen wie Schwangerschaftsabbruch und gleichgeschlechtlichen Partnerschaften einzunehmen. Zudem setzt die AfD darauf, enttäuschte SPD-Wähler anzusprechen, etwa mit Themen wie höheren Sozialleistungen. Tilman Steffen , Redakteur im Politikressort, analysiert die Strategie der AfD im Wahlkampf und ordnet ein, wie erfolgreich die Partei mit diesen Anpassungen möglicherweise sein könnte. Und sonst so?

About 23.7 million people, more than half of Afghanistan’s population, are in urgent need of humanitarian aid.

Afghanistan ranks among the most vulnerable countries globally to climate change and disaster risks. The country is also prone to earthquakes, with nearly 400 tremors recorded in the last three years, including significant quakes, such as the 6.3 magnitude in Herat Province in October last year. The compounding effects of disasters in the country have exacerbated the already fragile situation in Afghanistan. These successive disasters have pushed more Afghans into poverty and heightened their vulnerability. In addition, Afghanistan’s economic crisis is widespread, with more than half of households experiencing an economic shock. The country’s economy is heavily dependent on foreign aid and remittances, which have declined significantly since the political change in 2021. This has resulted in high levels of unemployment, challenging people’s coping mechanisms and thwarting the already fragile economy’s ability to adapt to shocks. The IFRC said more than 85 percent of the country’s population is now living below the poverty line.",

A delegation has traveled to Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, with the country hoping for financial assistance. This is the first time the Taliban will attend a UN climate conference since their takeover. The delegation, consisting of officials from the National Environmental Protection Agency, has already arrived in Azerbaijan. It is unclear what status the delegation will have, but they are likely to participate as observers. The Taliban government, which is not recognized by any state, was previously unsuccessful in attending the climate conferences in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2022 and Dubai in 2023. Afghanistan, a country that has suffered from war and poverty, is among the most affected by climate change. Despite this, the country has joined the Paris Climate Agreement and claims compensation from wealthier nations for climate-induced damages. Humanitarian organizations have reported malnutrition among Afghan children, attributing the precarious situation to economic instability and the effects of climate change.",

Bei der Weltklimakonferenz könnten die Islamisten nun aufs internationale Parkett zurückkehren, eine Delegation ist nach Baku gereist. Das Land hofft auf finanzielle Hilfe. Erstmals nach ihrer Machtübernahme 2021 werden die afghanischen Taliban an einer UN-Klimakonferenz teilnehmen. Eine afghanische Delegation werde bei der Weltklimakonferenz (COP29) in der aserbaidschanischen Hauptstadt Baku dabei sein, teilte der Sprecher des Außenministeriums in Kabul, Abdul Qahar Balkhi, mit. Beamte der Nationalen Umweltschutzbehörde seien bereits in Aserbaidschan eingetroffen. Welchen Status die Delegation haben wird, ist unklar. Vermutlich dürften die Islamisten jedoch nur als Beobachter an dem zweiwöchigen Treffen teilnehmen. Keine Teilnahme bei den vergangenen Klimakonferenzen Die Taliban-Regierung, die im Sommer 2021 die Macht in Afghanistan übernommen hatte, wird von keinem Staat anerkannt. Bei den UN-Klimakonferenzen im ägyptischen Scharm el-Scheich 2022 und in Dubai 2023 hatte Afghanistan sich vergeblich um eine Teilnahme bemüht. Auch sonst sind die Taliban international isoliert. Die Vereinten Nationen haben den Taliban etwa nicht erlaubt, den afghanischen Sitz in der Generalversammlung einzunehmen. Afghanistan leidet unter den Folgen des Klimawandels Das nach vielen Kriegsjahren verarmte Land am Hindukusch zählt zu den am stärksten vom Klimawandel betroffenen Ländern der Erde. Aserbaidschan als Gastgeber hatte im Februar seine Botschaft in Kabul wieder geöffnet. Eine offizielle Anerkennung der Taliban-Regierung ging damit allerdings nicht einher. Wie fast alle anderen Staaten der Erde ist auch Afghanistan dem Pariser Klimaabkommen beigetreten. Da das Land kaum Treibhausgase verursacht, aber stark unter den Folgen der Erderwärmung leidet, beansprucht Afghanistan, von reicheren Staaten für klimabedingte Schäden entschädigt zu werden. Hilfsorganisationen sprechen von einer Mangelernährung bei afghanischen Kindern. Ursachen für die prekäre Lage seien neben wirtschaftlicher Instabilität auch die Folgen des Klimawandels.",

They now control the country’s natural resources—wealth that once funded their war efforts through illegal mining—and have gained increased opportunities for exploitation as their criminal economic networks expand. Recently, the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs announced the launch of “exploration and extraction” at 21 major mines in Afghanistan. However, citizens and economic experts have raised concerns over the unregulated extraction and smuggling of minerals in the absence of a legitimate government. They argue that the mining operations lack transparency and accountability, endangering the future of the country’s mines. Without a legitimate political framework, experts claim that these mining contracts only benefit the Taliban, not Afghanistan. Many citizens believe that the Taliban, who previously funded part of their insurgency through illegal mining, now use the proceeds to strengthen their criminal economy. By signing mining contracts, they secure a significant portion of the revenue from these resources.

The Taliban's deputy foreign minister, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, has called on countries that were militarily involved in Afghanistan to help rebuild the country based on the Doha Agreement. He urged the United Nations and international NGOs to support Afghanistan through technical assistance, economic development initiatives, and agricultural cooperation. The Taliban hope to gain more support by participating in international forums like the recent UN Climate Conference. However, the international community does not recognize the Taliban as the government, and they have not upheld their commitments from the 2020 Doha Agreement, particularly regarding women's rights. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai criticized the Taliban for not representing the country or its people and called on Muslim countries and religious leaders to oppose the Taliban's stance. The Taliban have systematically excluded women and girls from public life, education, and the workforce, and restricted their freedom of movement. The economic situation has led to a high rate of child labor, with 19% of children in Afghanistan working as child laborers. The country is also facing severe malnutrition among children, with many suffering from growth disorders. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, heavily dependent on foreign aid, and under the Taliban's rule, there is no foreseeable improvement in living conditions for millions of women, children, and families.",

Länder, die militärisch in Afghanistan involviert waren, hätten eine moralische Verpflichtung, beim Wiederaufbau des Landes auf der Grundlage des Doha-Abkommens zu helfen, forderte Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai am 18. November in Kabul. Stanikzai ist der stellvertretende Außenminister der Taliban. Er forderte die Vereinten Nationen und internationale NGOs auf, Afghanistan in Form von technischer Hilfe, wirtschaftlichen Entwicklungsinitiativen und landwirtschaftlicher Zusammenarbeit zu unterstützen.\n\nDie Taliban hoffen, durch die Teilnahme an internationalen Foren wie der jüngsten UN-Klimakonferenz mehr Unterstützung zu erhalten. Laut Graeme Smith, Afghanistan-Experte der International Crisis Group, hatte das Land vor dem Machtwechsel der Taliban allein im Klimabereich Anspruch auf rund 800 Millionen Dollar aus dem Grünen Klimafonds (GCF), der Globalen Umweltfazilität und dem Anpassungsfonds.\n\nDie Mittel sollten ursprünglich für Projekte im Bereich erneuerbare Energien und Klimaanpassung verwendet werden. Durch die Machtübernahme der Taliban bleibt unklar, ob solche Projekte unter den neuen Gegebenheiten umgesetzt werden könnten.\n\nDie internationale Gemeinschaft erkennt die Taliban weiterhin nicht als Regierung an. Die Taliban haben ihre Verpflichtungen aus dem Doha-Abkommen von 2020, insbesondere in Bezug auf Frauenrechte, nicht eingehalten.\n\n\"Die Taliban behaupten, Vertreter der afghanischen Kultur und Religion zu sein. Doch in Wahrheit sind sie eine kleine Gruppe von Männern, die weder das Land noch alle Stimmen in diesem Land repräsentieren\", kritisierte die Friedensnobelpreisträgerin Malala Yousafzai Mitte November im Gespräch mit der DW. Malala, der im Alter von 15 Jahren bei einem Attentat von den Taliban in dem Kopf geschossen und dabei schwer verletzt wurde, setzt sich seit ihrer Genesung für das Recht auf Bildung, insbesondere für Mädchen, ein.\n\n\"Der Islam verbietet einem Mädchen nicht, zu lernen. Der Islam verbietet einer Frau nicht, zu arbeiten\", betonte Malala. Sie forderte muslimische Länder und religiöse Führer auf, sich klar gegen die Haltung der Taliban zu positionieren. Nach der Machtübernahme im Sommer 2021 begannen die Taliban, Frauen und Mädchen systematisch aus dem öffentlichen Leben zu verdrängen. Sie wurden von Bildungseinrichtungen und dem Arbeitsmarkt ausgeschlossen und ihre Bewegungsfreiheit wurde stark eingeschränkt.\n\n\"Ich bin glücklich, wenn ich arbeiten und Geld verdienen kann. Zur Schule darf ich nicht mehr gehen\", erzählt Mehrsana eine junge Frau aus der Provinz Herat, die auf einer Safranfarm arbeitet. Die Farm, auf der ausschließliche Frauen arbeiten, bietet nur für einen Monat im Jahr eine Beschäftigung. Eine dauerhafte Arbeit oder Ausbildung bleibt für sie unerreichbar.\n\nMinderjährige wie sie gehören zu den Hauptleidtragenden der katastrophalen Wirtschaftslage. Neunzehn Prozent der Kinder in Afghanistan arbeiten als Kinderarbeiter, teilte die Afghanistan-Abteilung des Büros der Vereinten Nationen für die Koordinierung humanitärer Angelegenheiten (OCHA) vor dem internationalen Tag der Kinderrechte am 20. November mit.\n\nKurz vor Beginn des Winters warnte die Föderation der Rotkreuz- und Rothalbmondgesellschaften (IFRC) eindringlich vor den Folgen der akuten Mangelernährung bei Kindern. „Das Ausmaß der Unterernährung in unserem Land ist erschütternd\", erklärte Mohammad Nabi Burhan, Generalsekretär des afghanischen Roten Halbmonds, im Oktober. Viele Kinder seien geschwächt, einige hätten bereits Wachstumsstörungen entwickelt.\n\nAfghanistan zählt zu den ärmsten Ländern der Welt und war vor der Machtübernahme der Taliban stark von Hilfsgeldern abhängig. 2020 belief sich das Bruttoinlandsprodukt (BIP) des Landes auf knapp 20 Milliarden US-Dollar, wovon fast die Hälfte aus ausländischen Hilfszahlungen stammte. Unter der Herrschaft der Taliban, die an ihrer Position festhalten, ist eine Verbesserung der Lebensbedingungen für Millionen von Frauen, Kindern und Familien derzeit nicht absehbar.\n\nAutor: Shabnam von Hein\n\nVon Shabnam von Hein",

郭涵】就业、基建、禁毒、妇女问题，塔利班这三年来做了什么观察者网：从2021年8月上台至今3年多以来，塔利班在阿富汗的执政给您留下最深刻的印象是什么？余明辉：我认为最大的变化就是阿塔作为执政党，更成熟了。2021年夺取政权时，他们吸取了之前的教训，姿态放得比较低。我还记得2021年8月15日那一天，塔利班进入喀布尔，重新掌控了阿富汗整个国家。当时我们在中国城，非常担心失去秩序后有流民抢劫。但塔利班实际进城只用了一天，而且到处张贴安民告示，过程也没有太大的波澜。塔利班新上任的警察局长还派周边街区的人过来，问我们有什么安全方面的需求，如果需要派兵保卫的话也没问题，提出可以把哨所设在中国城对面。他们当时强调最多的一点就是，我们不会骚扰你们、不会蹭你们的饭（他们中午都是吃自己带的馕），不会像原政权的警察那样办什么事都要收钱。后来，塔利班内政部给我们办了一份安全保障的文件，证明我们在这里经营多年，不允许任何其它的部门来骚扰，基本上就是这个情况。2024年8月14日拍摄的阿富汗首都喀布尔。新华社我个人认为，塔利班付出了很大努力想证明，他们和被推翻的那个民选政府有很大不同。他们想强调自身不会贪腐，而且也想做成事。比如塔利班刚上台时，阿富汗驻华大使馆和喀布尔断了联系。我们国内有两位某研究院的研究员希望去阿富汗及时开展调研，但是办不了签证，于是托我们去联系塔利班政府里的人，然后很快做了特殊安排。英国BBC还报道了这件事，说中国的几家企业可以拿特殊签证进阿富汗。还有一个对比是，8年前我们想找原阿富汗政府申请一个钢厂的二期建设审批，但是政府审批的进度很慢，一年办一点手续、推进得很慢，每当有政府部门更换部长时就卡我们。这事一直拖到塔利班上台后，我们去找新的土地部长，用了一年时间就由经济委员会给批下来了。观察者网：塔利班今年8月份公布了执政成绩，过去一年来在全国启动了400多项工程，提供了超过1.5万个就业岗位，并对喀布尔的国际机场进行翻修。能否聊聊塔利班政府在基础设施建设方面的一手观察？余明辉：首先，对于这些公开的政绩，实际情况你大致可以打一个对折。我是这样看的，在中东一些地方搞基建，按照他们自身的起点和标准来说，这确实算是很不错的成绩。但是以我们中国人的基建效率来看，这不算什么，深圳当年的“一天一层楼”，那才是中国人习惯的效率。客观地说，阿富汗这边开展基建的进度相当缓慢，但这不仅仅是阿富汗，而是包括中亚五国、伊朗、阿联酋等国家的普遍情况。塔利班正在做一些修路架桥的工作，因为过去基本上是“百废待兴”的状态。他们说启动了工程，但没有明确说这些工程什么时候完工，对吧？我们最近去乌兹别克斯坦驻喀布尔的大使馆交流，使馆门口的整个一条街都被挖开，在修下水道，打算铺上柏油路。柏油路在喀布尔还算比较普遍，但这里85%以上的地区是没有下水道的。我在使馆的交流会上，和一个之前在城建部门工作的阿富汗人聊天，说到修路的情况，他说现在每天要很早起床工作，晚上还要加班，可没有过去那么闲了。观察者网：您2022年初曾在观察者网撰文，谈到了在政权更替时期，美国依然冻结原阿富汗政府主权资产，外界广泛担忧阿富汗饥荒问题将会严重恶化。这个问题后续情况如何？余明辉：这也算是外国媒体最关心的话题了。他们总是会提，阿富汗在塔利班上台之前就陷入人道主义危机，50%甚至更多的人口面临饥荒或者营养不良之类。我不能代表别人，但是我们在喀布尔中国城以及合作工厂里的几百名阿富汗工人中做过详细调研，问他们（不同省份的）老家有没有饿死人的，没有一个人说有。但是，有些地方有人吸大烟，吸得迷糊了最后冻死，这种情况是存在的，虽然并不多。我们也亲自去过一些矿山所在的山村探访，哪怕是最贫穷的家庭里面也有一些土豆和馕，他们可能吃不上肉，但是基本口粮还是有的。阿富汗村庄里正在享用晚餐的一家人。网络我从塔利班上台之前就开始观察，这四五年间，我认为一些联合国机构在当地统计的数字并不完全准确。这些机构在国际上都比较权威、知名度很高，也在阿富汗设置了项目部，从事各种各样的业务。我观察，大部分联合国工作人员是清廉的，但是对阿富汗具体情况掌握的不够充分。因为他们在这里摸底，主要还是依靠阿富汗本地人去做调查、探访和收集信息。由于这些数据决定了联合国、国际社会对阿富汗的援助力度，所以，阿富汗人确实存在通过夸大灾情，包括贫困和饥荒的数字，进而争取到更多国际援助的这样一种心理。如果不是亲自去到阿富汗，或者是和当地人打交道时间比较短，确实很难了解到真实的情况。观察者网：塔利班上台后推进的禁毒政策也引发了外界关注，成效如何？余明辉：简单来说，塔利班刚上台的时候，也就是从2021年8月到2022年8月这第一年，花了大力气把禁毒当作一项标志性政绩，包括建立了一些禁毒院。我们以前在喀布尔各个街区都能看到三五成群的吸毒者，把被子蒙在头上，警察都管不了。但是塔利班上台以后，把这些吸毒贩毒的人几乎全都肃清了。这也应了我前面说的，塔利班二次上台后确实比他们第一次上台执政时更加成熟，开始注重国际形象，禁毒这件事就很好地树立了一种形象。当然，随着塔利班开始把工作重心转向经济建设、发展同周边和其它国家贸易上面，到了执政第三年，零星的贩毒吸毒活动又有点死灰复燃的迹象，但是没有前一任政府时期那么明目张胆。至于以后会不会又蔓延，谁也不好讲。观察者网：塔利班政府成员的宗教背景，是否会和追求世俗化的治理与发展目标产生矛盾？最近也有所谓“塔利班禁止女性在公共场合说话”的新闻登上热搜，您能向国内读者介绍一下实际情况吗？余明辉：你刚才说的那个报道是不实消息。塔利班政府在今年8月通过了一个《道德法》，并且把原来政府的“妇女权益保障部”改成了“劝善惩恶部”，负责执行那部法律。至于说女性在公共场合不能说话，这是不存在的。哪怕只是一位埃米尔看似提出了这样的想法，也不可能做到。这部法律颁布到现在几个月了，我们从来没有看见有人因为犯了这一条被抓的。塔利班对妇女权利的限制是不是非常严重？是。有没有像国内部分媒体（他们跟西方媒体一个口径）描绘的那样变成“人间地狱”？没有。现在我们都能在街上看到买菜、去商场购物的阿富汗妇女，她们一样能讲话，当然她们的衣着相比以前更加趋于保守。阿富汗喀布尔街头的行人。视频截图我问过一些塔利班官员这个话题，他们给我的解释，不管是否让人信服，就是阿富汗对妇女形象的看法应该是比较高贵。如果她们在公共场合大声喧嚣、与人产生争执，不利于维持妇女的端庄形象。中国企业投资阿富汗，一定要做好前期调研观察者网：除了主权资产在美国被冻结，塔利班政府也面临着无法获得国际承认的困境。这对经济有哪些影响，塔利班政府是否有可能采取行动改善困境？余明辉：短期内走出这个困境还是比较难。原因有三个方面：首先，塔利班这边有非常多的人权问题不良纪录，这是难以抹清的；第二，目前阿富汗问题不是国际关注的焦点，俄乌冲突、加沙冲突才是现在的焦点。就算塔利班希望向美国等西方国家让步，达成妥协，那些国家暂时也没有精力操心这件事；最后，可以明显感知到联合国在阿富汗的作用在下降，多年以来设置的交流和沟通机制，目前都无法起到比较大的作用。观察者网：能否从一名华商的个人角度，聊聊您对塔利班政府在招商引资问题上的观察？余明辉：打个比方，比如你要用手推一辆汽车，如果你知道从正确的地方发力，那么只需要8成力道就能推动汽车前进。用的力道不对，再怎么使劲都是白忙活。我认为如果塔利班把精力集中在正确的地方，方法得当，阿富汗会迎来非常快的发展，但至少到目前，我们还没有观察到这样的现象发生。塔利班当然在用力推，但是比较缺乏搞经济建设的经验，在很多地方白白消耗精力，导致无法全力推动经济发展。这也是我们在不同场合同塔利班政府代表对话时一直讲的，可以向中国学习的原因之一。举个例子，不只是塔利班，许多伊斯兰国家的政府手上有资金时最喜欢做一件事，就是建设漂亮的城市。因为这是立竿见影的成绩，老百姓马上就能看见。在中东那些搞现代化落后了差不多几百年的国家，现代化在他们眼中就意味着高楼大厦，这是让老百姓感受最直观，帮助他们建立对政权合法性认同的最有说服力的方式。但是我在交流中跟他们说，你们看北京、上海、深圳和广州这些城市灯火辉煌、到处是高楼大厦，在表面的背后，中国政府付出了很大的心血。中国上世纪80年代搞改革开放的时候也有将近10亿人口，这个庞大基数承担了试错的成本，阿富汗能承担试错的成本吗？中国的基建行业也是一步步发展起来的，到现在不管是质量、成本还是效率都是世界第一，但这不是一天就能实现的。同样一件东西，如果今天中国来做是一件完美的成品，但阿富汗按同样的方式做可能就是个次品。他们政府里的人听了也哈哈大笑，说确实是这样，所以要向中国学习，包括搞工业建设、经济发展都是同样的逻辑。他们想学中国的现成经验，但是不能生搬硬套。如果你说现在要学习西班牙，学美国、英国还是伊朗，可能都不适合阿富汗的国情。当地时间9月3日，安全人员在喀布尔街头检查过往车辆。新华社当然，我前面说的也不代表塔利班政府想要搞“面子工程”，因为这个词包含的前提是你的民生建设已经饱和了，再搞工程也不会带来实际效益。但是，阿富汗国内现在很多基础的房屋建设条件还很差，甚至政府办公楼的楼梯都不平整，要错开上下行。保守地说，阿富汗至少10年内都不存在真正意义上的“面子工程”。观察者网：对于有意愿投资阿富汗的中国企业，您有没有什么建议？对于塔利班政府改善营商环境的努力，您有哪些具体的建议或期待？余明辉：我印象特别深的是，外交部亚洲司刘劲松司长曾经对中企投资阿富汗提过一个建议。因为刘司长曾在阿富汗做过大使，为两国之间的交往做了很多工作，包括开通“松子空中走廊”，协助对阿富汗青少年先天病的治疗等等。他说企业一定要做好前期的可行性调研。比如你一个亿的项目，可能就要花5%甚至到10%的调研费。如果是两三百万的项目，也要有二三十万的调研费。这个基础工作做不好，就很容易吃亏。很多企业看到了塔利班欢迎投资，中国政府也不反对，但一方面那些是政治层面的表态，在商务层面是来不得半点马虎的，每一个产品或市场，每一个客户都要靠谈判来确定，这是非常专业的过程。最近一年来，上百家企业来阿富汗进行咨询调研，我也跟他们说这个问题。最后能落地的很少，这里面有企业的问题，也有塔利班政府的问题。一是部分中国企业还是抱有侥幸心理，觉得他可以是例外，运气会很好。但例外是不存在的，一定要谨慎调研。另一方面，我们对塔利班的建议也是，要尊重以互惠互利为基础的商业法则。塔利班政府里有部分人存在不切实际的认识：他们觉得自己打了40多年的仗，落得如此贫穷的地步，是国际社会欠他们的，国际社会就应该向他们提供援助。除了联合国与主权国家的官方援助外，也有国企、私企的投资是要追求利润回报的。也许一笔战略投资无法在一年两年内盈利，但是人家都会有商业计划书，是一定要按着那些方案推进的。对于这些商业计划书、商业合同，应该有清晰的法律法规来确保执行，保护外国人和外国投资的权益。这是主权国家间开展商业活动、处理纠纷时的自然道理。现在塔利班张开双臂欢迎周边国家投资，对来自中国的投资抱有的期望最大。但请客吃饭不仅仅是把人请到家里招待，而是要有清晰的投资法与相关保障机制。对于完善法律法规、法治和制度建设这方面的薄弱，塔利班其实是还没有充分意识到。我们跟一些塔利班官员提到这些建议，他们每个人都同意，觉得很有道理，但是每一个单独的官员都无法当家，也就是推动制定一套完善的法律法规体制。确实有不少中国企业在这方面吃亏，我们也觉得很惋惜。有些企业进入阿富汗的时间只有三五年，最多六七年，他们仅仅看到了表面，还没有看到更深层的原因。有些企业认为塔利班对投资很热情，很客气，有阿富汗人骗了中企的钱，塔利班的警察马上把那些人抓起来打一顿，等等。但商业投资的逻辑比这些表象更深。",

Barqi Tojik is now responsible for as well the export of the electricity to the abroad. Citing Hekmatullah Maiwandi, a spokesperson for DABS, yesterday that the deal will help meet Afghanistan’s electricity needs, as the country imports up to 70% of its electricity from neighboring countries, including Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Iran. Afghanistan relies heavily on electricity imports from Central Asian countries, particularly Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, to meet its domestic energy needs. This dependency has persisted in recent years, exacerbated by growing internal demand and limited domestic power generation capacity. Afghanistan reportedly requires approximately 6,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity annually, with around 86 percent of its energy imported from neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. notes that while the deal secures electricity imports for the future, residents in Kabul are grappling with severe power outages as winter approaches. Many report having electricity for only four to six hours a day. “The lack of sufficient electricity, combined with economic hardships, is creating serious challenges for us as we prepare for the winter,” one Kabul resident was cited as saying. Volumes and costs of supplies, as well as other agreement details, remain undisclosed. In 2008, the two countries signed a general agreement on the supply of electricity from Tajikistan to Afghanistan until 2028. At the end of each calendar year, the parties sign an additional protocol specifying the volumes and prices of electricity for the following year.

It helps me cover my basic needs and sustain my daily life,” she said.\n\n“I have no other way to earn a living. I wait for the saffron harvest season every year to collect these flowers,” she said.\n\nSaffron cultivation has been steadily expanding in the war-torn country over the past two decades. More farmers are turning to this precious crop, drawn by its profitability. \n\nCurrently, around 9,000 hectares of land are dedicated to saffron cultivation in Afghanistan, with approximately 95 per cent concentrated in Herat province, according to Chairman of Tulai Surkh Afghan (Afghan Red Gold) Abdul Shakor Ehrari, a leading saffron processing company. According to the official, Saffron cultivation in Afghanistan, especially in the Herat province, continues to grow as farmers aim to harvest more and earn better incomes.\n\n“Based on the reports we have received from partner bodies, some 8,000 to 9,000 hectares of lands have been cultivated saffron in Afghanistan with 85 to 95 per cent of them only in Herat,” Ehrari told Xinhua in his saffron farms recently.\n\nAccording to Ehrari, the saffron harvest season provides employment for between 500,000 and one million workers across the country. He predicts a significant increase in this year’s yield, estimating a harvest of up to 40 tonnes of saffron compared to last year’s 35 tonnes.\n\nFor workers like 39-year-old Hatam, the harvest season offers a source of stability. “I collect about 12 kilogrammes of saffron flowers each day. Life goes on. I work here and am satisfied with the outcome of my efforts,” Hatam told Xinhua on the saffron farm in Herat recently. Despite the hardships, the growing saffron cultivation continues to offer hope and opportunities in Afghanistan, contributing to both individual livelihoods and the national economy.",

These women are not only supporting themselves but also creating jobs for others in a country where women's employment in the public sector has dropped to zero. Despite challenges such as restricted movement and limited access to markets, the number of women joining the Afghan Women's Chamber of Commerce and Industries (AWCCI) has surged, indicating a growing entrepreneurial spirit among Afghan women.",

Comme elle, de nombreuses Afghanes lancent leur affaire, pour subvenir à leurs besoins et assurer ceux de leurs employées.\n\nHuit mois après la chute de Kaboul, Mme Ferozi a investi 20.000 afghanis, environ 275 euros, amassés en donnant des cours de tissage, pour ouvrir son atelier à Hérat, dans l’Ouest.\n\nAujourd’hui, dit-elle à l’AFP avec fierté, elle « couvre toutes les dépenses du foyer » parce que son mari, journalier, peine à travailler.\n\nSa quinzaine de tisseuses sont d’anciennes travailleuses ayant perdu leur emploi ou des étudiantes frappées par l’interdiction faite aux filles d’étudier au-delà de 12 ans. Sous cet « apartheid de genre » selon l’ONU, le taux d’emploi des femmes dans le service public est passé de 26% « à zéro ».\n\nTouba Zahid, 28 ans et mère d’un enfant, a elle aussi dû rebondir après avoir été bannie de sa faculté de littérature. Dans le sous-sol de sa maison, elle fabrique confitures et condiments.\n\nBoom à la chambre du Commerce\n\n« J’ai rejoint le monde des affaires pour créer de l’emploi et pour que les femmes puissent avoir un salaire », raconte à l’AFP cette Afghane menue, souriante au milieu de ses employées en blouses blanches.\n\nEnsemble, elles présentent les pots de confiture de figues et autres légumes marinés qui seront vendus sur place car les femmes sont de moins en moins admises en public.\n\nSi certaines tiennent des échoppes, les marchés sont dominés par les hommes et « il n’y a pas de commerciales pour vendre ou promouvoir leurs produits », se lamente Fariba Noori, à la tête de la Chambre de commerce des femmes (AWCCI) à Kaboul.\n\nLes femmes peinent aussi à s’approvisionner car elles ne se sont plus autorisées à faire de longs déplacements sans un chaperon mâle de leur famille, un « mahram », une gageure dans un pays où quatre décennies de guerres ont laissé de nombreuses veuves et orphelines.\n\nTrouver « un mahram pour aller acheter leurs matières premières » est un défi, assure Mme Noori.\n\nMalgré tout, l’AWCCI voit ses adhésions exploser: 10.000 aujourd’hui, principalement des PME, contre « 600 grosses entreprises » en 2021, rapporte celle qui a rejoint le patronat il y a 12 ans.\n\n« Sans comparaison »\n\nKhadija Mohammadi, elle, a lancé sa marque « Khadija » de tapis et de couture il y a deux ans. Professeure mise au chômage par les nouvelles lois talibanes, elle emploie maintenant plus de 200 femmes.\n\n« Je suis fière à chaque fois qu’une femme aide une autre à devenir indépendante », lance cette Afghane apprêtée qui dit payer ses employées entre 5.000 et 13.000 afghanis, soit 70 et 180 euros par mois.\n\nL’une d’elles, Qamar Qasimi, travaillait encore l’an dernier dans un salon d’esthétique depuis fermé.\n\nAujourd’hui, cette mère de 24 ans avoue tisser des tapis pour 5.000 afghanis parce qu’elle n’a « pas d’autre choix » pour subvenir aux besoins des huit membres de sa famille.\n\n« Comme esthéticienne, je pouvais gagner entre 3.000 et 7.000 afghanis en maquillant et en coiffant une seule mariée. C’est sans comparaison », affirme-t-elle, au milieu de femmes qui s’activent.\n\nIl n’y a pas que les salons de beauté qui ont fermé. La plupart des espaces où les femmes pouvaient se retrouver ont suivi. \n\nPour tenter de leur offrir malgré tout un espace de détente, Zohra Gonish, 20 ans, a ouvert un restaurant réservé aux femmes à Badakhchan, dans le nord-est frontalier de la Chine.\n\n« Troubles psychologiques »\n\n« Les femmes peuvent venir pour des événements ou pour manger. Toutes nos employées sont des femmes pour que nos clientes soient à l’aise », explique-t-elle.\n\nSi elle parle fièrement de son projet, en 2022 Zohra Gonish a dû batailler pour l’imposer dans un pays où la part des femmes dans le monde du travail est dix fois inférieure à la moyenne mondiale. \n\nElle a insisté une semaine auprès de son père qui a fini par céder quand elle a expliqué vouloir « être financièrement indépendante mais aussi l’aider », alors qu’un tiers des 45 millions d’habitants de l’Afghanistan survivent au pain et au thé.\n\nC’est aussi pour aider ses parents que Soumaya Ahmadi a rejoint l’usine de tapis de Mme Ferozi à 15 ans à peine.\n\nPrivée d’école et « déprimée », elle voulait à tout prix sortir de chez elle.\n\n« A la maison, j’étais énervée. Maintenant, on travaille et ça nous fait du bien, nos troubles psychologiques ont disparu », déclare-t-elle.\n\nAvec son salaire, elle veut s’assurer que ses deux frères, eux, ne seront pas privés d’éducation.\n\n« Comme les écoles sont fermées aux filles, je travaille à leur place », indique Soumaya Ahmadi.\n\n« Je leur dis d’étudier pour pouvoir faire quelque chose de leur vie ».",

I’m happier and I feel better.”\n\nThe work has also given her a new goal: to help her two brothers build their futures.\n\n“Because schools’ doors are closed to girls, I work instead of my brothers so they can study and do something with their lives.”",

                                    "content": "KABUL — When Zainab Ferozi saw Afghan women struggling to feed their families after Taliban authorities took power, she took matters into her own hands and poured her savings into starting a business.Two-and-a-half years after putting 20,000 Afghanis ($300) earned from teaching sewing classes into a carpet weaving enterprise, she now employs around a dozen women who lost their jobs or who had to abandon their education due to Taliban government rules.Through her business in the western province of Herat, the 39-year-old also 'covers all the household expenses' of her family of six, she told Agence France-Presse from her office where samples of brightly colored and exquisitely woven rugs and bags are displayed.Her husband, a laborer, cannot find work in one of the poorest countries in the world.Ferozi is one of many women who have launched small businesses in the past three years to meet their own needs and support other Afghan women, whose employment sharply declined after the Taliban took power in 2021.Before the Taliban takeover, women made up 26 percent of public sector workers, a figure that 'has effectively decreased to zero,' according to United Nations Women.Girls and women have also been banned from secondary schools and universities under restrictions the UN has described as 'gender apartheid.'Touba Zahid, a 28-year-old mother-of-one, started making jams and pickles in the small basement of her home in the capital Kabul after she was forced to stop her university education.'I came into the world of business... to create job opportunities for women so they can have an income that at least covers their immediate needs,' Zahid said.Half a dozen of her employees, wearing long white coats, were busy jarring jams and pickles labeled 'Mom's delicious homecooking.'Growing number of businessesWhile women may be making the stock, running the shops in Afghanistan remains mostly a man's job.Saleswomen like Zahid 'cannot go to the bazaar to promote and sell their products' themselves, said Fariba Noori, chairwoman of the Afghanistan Women's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (AWCCI).Another issue for Afghan businesswomen is the need for a 'mahram' — a male family member chaperone — to accompany them to other cities or provinces to purchase raw materials, said Noori.After 40 years of successive conflicts, many Afghan women have been widowed and lost many male relatives.Despite these challenges, the number of businesses registered with AWCCI has increased since the Taliban takeover, according to Noori.The number went 'from 600 big companies to 10,000,' mainly small, home-based businesses and a few bigger companies, said Noori, herself a businesswoman for 12 years.Khadija Mohammadi, who launched her eponymous brand in 2022 after she lost her private school teaching job, now employs more than 200 women sewing dresses and weaving carpets.'I am proud of every woman who is giving a hand to another woman to help her become independent,' said the 26-year-old.Though businesses like Mohammadi's are a lifeline, the salaries, ranging from 5,000 to 13,000 Afghanis, cannot cover all costs and many women are still stalked by economic hardship.Qamar Qasimi, who lost her job as a beautician after the Taliban authorities banned beauty salons in 2023, said that even with her salary, she and her husband struggle to pay rent and feed their family of eight.'When I worked in the beauty salon, we could earn 3,000-7,000 Afghanis for styling one bride, but here we get 5,000 per month,' said the 24-year-old.'It's not comparable, but I have no other choice,' she added, the room around her full of women chatting as they worked at 30 looms.Women-only spacesThe closure of beauty salons was not only a financial blow but also removed key spaces for women to socialize.Zohra Gonish decided to open a restaurant to create a women-only space in northeastern Badakhshan province.'Women can come here and relax,' said the 20-year-old entrepreneur.'We wanted the staff to be women so that the women customers can feel comfortable here.'But starting her business in 2022, aged 18, was not easy in a country where the labor force participation for women is 10 times lower than the world average, according to the World Bank.It took Gonish a week to convince her father to support her.Aside from helping their families and having space to socialize, some women said work has given them a sense of purpose.Sumaya Ahmadi, 15, joined Ferozi's carpet company to help her parents after she had to leave school and became 'very depressed.''[Now] I'm very happy, and I no longer have any mental health problems. I'm happier, and I feel better.'The work has also given her a new goal: to help her two brothers build their futures.'Because schools' doors are closed to girls, I work instead of my brothers so they can study and do something with their lives.",

                                    "content": "KABUL: When Zainab Ferozi saw Afghan women struggling to feed their families after Taleban authorities took power, she took matters into her own hands and poured her savings into starting a business. Two-and-a-half years after putting 20,000 Afghanis ($300) earned from teaching sewing classes into a carpet weaving enterprise, she now employs around a dozen women who lost their jobs or who had to abandon their education due to Taleban government rules.\n\nThrough her business in the western province of Herat, the 39-year-old also “covers all the household expenses” of her family of six, she told AFP from her office where samples of brightly colored and exquisitely woven rugs and bags are displayed. Her husband, a laborer, cannot find work in one of the poorest countries in the world. Ferozi is one of many women who have launched small businesses in the past three years to meet their own needs and support other Afghan women, whose employment sharply declined after the Taleban took power in 2021.\n\nBefore the Taleban takeover, women made up 26 percent of public sector workers, a figure that “has effectively decreased to zero”, according to UN Women. Girls and women have also been banned from secondary schools and universities under restrictions the UN has described as “gender apartheid”. Touba Zahid, a 28-year-old mother-of-one, started making jams and pickles in the small basement of her home in the capital Kabul after she was forced to stop her university education. “I came into the world of business... to create job opportunities for women so they can have an income that at least covers their immediate needs,” Zahid said. Half a dozen of her employees, wearing long white coats, were busy jarring jams and pickles labeled “Mom’s delicious homecooking”.\n\nWhile women may be making the stock, running the shops in Afghanistan remains mostly a man’s job. Saleswomen like Zahid “cannot go to the bazaar to promote and sell their products” themselves, said Fariba Noori, chairwoman of the Afghanistan Women’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry (AWCCI). Another issue for Afghan businesswomen is the need for a “mahram” - a male family member chaperone - to accompany them to other cities or provinces to purchase raw materials, said Noori. After 40 years of successive conflicts, many Afghan women have been widowed and lost many male relatives. \n\nDespite these challenges, the number of businesses registered with AWCCI has increased since the Taleban takeover, according to Noori. The number went “from 600 big companies to 10,000” mainly small, home-based businesses and a few bigger companies, said Noori, herself a businesswoman for 12 years. Khadija Mohammadi, who launched her eponymous brand in 2022 after she lost her private school teaching job, now employs more than 200 women sewing dresses and weaving carpets. “I am proud of every woman who is giving a hand to another woman to help her become independent,” said the 26-year-old.\n\nThough businesses like Mohammadi’s are a lifeline, the salaries ranging from 5,000 to 13,000 Afghanis, cannot cover all costs and many women are still stalked by economic hardship. Qamar Qasimi, who lost her job as a beautician after the Taleban authorities banned beauty salons in 2023, said that even with her salary she and her husband struggle to pay rent and feed their family of eight. “When I worked in the beauty salon, we could earn 3,000-7,000 Afghanis for styling one bride, but here we get 5,000 per month,” said the 24-year-old. “It’s not comparable but I have no other choice,” she added, the room around her full of women chatting as they worked at 30 looms.\n\nWomen-only spaces \n\nThe closure of beauty salons was not only a financial blow, but also removed key spaces for women to socialize. Zohra Gonish decided to open a restaurant to create a women-only space in northeastern Badakhshan province. “Women can come here and relax,” said the 20-year-old entrepreneur. “We wanted the staff to be women so that the women customers can feel comfortable here.” But starting her business in 2022, aged 18 was not easy in a country where the labor force participation for women is 10 times lower than the world average, according to the World Bank. It took Gonish a week to convince her father to support her.\n\nAside from helping their families and having space to socialize, some women said work has given them a sense of purpose. Sumaya Ahmadi, 15, joined Ferozi’s carpet company to help her parents after she had to leave school and became “very depressed”. “(Now) I’m very happy and I no longer have any mental health problems. I’m happier and I feel better.” The work has also given her a new goal: to help her two brothers build their futures. “Because schools’ doors are closed to girls, I work instead of my brothers so they can study and do something with their lives.”- AFP",

                                    "content": "Low IQ leftwing propagandist Ravi Nair recently became a butt of all jokes after he compared the Afghan currency with the Indian rupee to take a swipe at the Modi government. \n\nNair, infamous for being a loyal henchman for the far-leftist propaganda portals like The Wire, Newsclick, etc. to promote wild allegations and ridiculously nonsensical insinuations against the Modi regime, posted a tweet that implied that the Afghanistan’s currency is stronger than the Indian Rupee because 1 Afghani is equivalent to Rs 1.26.\n\nWhile one cannot be sure whether Nair was being naturally retard or deliberately disingenous to fool his brainless followers into beliving that a perpetually strife-torn country’s currency could be stronger than the world’s fifth largest economy, it, nevertheless, failed to deceive social media users who ridiculed him for his insanine comparison.\n\nSocial media users from India as well as around the world mocked Nair for his tweet insinuating that the Afghan economy is stronger than the Indian economy. \n\nThere are several flaws in Nair’s assertions, the primary being a unit of one currency greater than a unit of other currency being an indicator of the former’s economy being in a better shape than the latter’s. Economy of a nation, by its depth and complexity, is an incredibly profound concept that cannot be pinned down to just how a country’s currency fares as compared to another country’s currency. \n\nFor instance, an Indian Rupee is equivalent to 1.84 Japenese Yen doesn’t mean that the Indian economy is bigger than Japan’s. India’s economy size is slated to be $3.89 trillion in nominal GDP while Japan’s $4.1 trillion. Despite being in greater in size, the Japanese currency is almost 50 percent weaker than the Indian Rupee. \n\nSecondly, the Afghan currency (Afghani) has indeed improved dramatically following the ouster of the United States and Talibani takeover in May 2021, but it is chiefly because for a long time before the Taliban’s return, the government in Afghanistan was controlled by the US and the Afghans had started using US dollars and Pakistani rupee locally.\n\nThe Taliban had banned using them after coming to power and enforced the use of Afghan Afghani as the national currency. The Taliban had also outlawed online trading and threatened those who violate the rules with imprisonment. This had naturally spiked demand for Afghan rupee and its value had improved significantly, while the economy remains poor and dismally undiversified, rendering it risk-prone to the vagaries of global economies and supply-chain woes. \n\nBut Modi detractors like Nair are not bothered by such nuances since genuine criticism of the governmemt has never been their priority. They are preoccupied with weaving a web of negative campaign against the Modi government and discredit them, even if that means fooling their followers and employing sophistries to further their agenda. \n\nIt is notable to mention that Nair was schooled by the Election Commission of India earlier this year for casting aspersions on EVMs. Ravi Nair had alleged that because the VVPAT machine sends some data to the Control Unit, like battery charge and the paper availability, it means that VVPAT communicates with the CU, with the implication that this can be used to manipulate vote data stored in the control unit.\n\nResponding to a post by left-wing propagandist Ravi Nair aimed at casting aspersions on EVMs, the Election Commission of India (ECI) schooled him on Sunday (14th April) about the basic functioning of EVM machines. The poll body also highlighted the ‘difference’ between the basic English words ‘command’ and ‘communication’ to point out the mischievous blunder in Nair’s post. \n\nNair had also been at the forefront of the disinformation campaign mounted by Congress and Rahul Gandhi over the purchase of Rafale jets with the French aviation company Dassault. Though Congress and opposition shills tried really hard to entangle the Modi government in what they called ‘Rafale scam’, the allegations fell flat as the Supreme Court pronounced that there was no wrongdoing in the deal. After EVMs and Rafale deal, this time, Nair seems to have zeroed in on the economy to embarrass himself.",

The analysis indicates a $61 million increase in exports during October.\n\nSimilarly, the total import value for September 2024 stood at $954.1 million, rising by $186.8 million in October, signaling a notable increase in the volume of imported goods.\n\nThe data further shows that the majority of exports in October were directed to India, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates, while most imports came from Iran, Pakistan, and China.\n\nIt is noteworthy that exports include both primary exports and re-exports, while imports encompass tariffed and non-tariffed goods, excluding electricity imports.\n\nDespite the trade growth reflected in these figures, Afghanistan faces a dire humanitarian crisis exacerbated by extreme poverty, limited resources, and insufficient funding for aid organizations. The looming harsh winter threatens millions who are already struggling with food insecurity and inadequate shelter.\n\nRestrictions on women’s education and employment have further deepened the crisis, limiting household incomes and reducing the capacity of aid organizations to operate effectively.

He stated that if the world wants to reduce poverty, Afghanistan should be the starting point.\n\nOsmani emphasized that poppy cultivation in Afghanistan has nearly reached zero. He also called on the international community to implement alternative crop programs for Afghan farmers, noting that poppies are not only a challenge for Afghanistan but also pose a problem for the world.\n\nSpeaking about the Islamic Emirate’s delegation’s participation in the conference, ministry spokesperson Misbahuddin Mustaeen said: “Alhamdulillah, Afghanistan is one of the countries highly suited for growth and development. If the world aims to reduce poverty, it would be wise to begin with Afghanistan, as it is now a secure place for all. Agriculture, mining, industry, and trade are growing here.”\n\nAccording to some experts, international support, especially from China, could significantly boost Afghanistan’s agricultural sector, thereby strengthening the country’s economy.\n\nMohammad Nabi Afghan, an economic analyst, told TOLOnews, “We need to focus on standardizing our agriculture and finding ways to bring high-quality products to global markets to increase our income and make the most of the present era.”\n\nAnother economic expert, Abdul Ghafar Nizami, said, “The Islamic Emirate alone cannot manage this task. The world needs to invest in Afghanistan to address issues such as water shortages on existing farmland and to irrigate unused land, which will expand agricultural production.”\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock also noted that, twenty years ago, Afghanistan was the largest producer of illicit drugs. However, since the Islamic Emirate’s return to power and the issuance of a ban on poppy cultivation, production has nearly ceased, and farmers have turned to cultivating lawful crops.",

The acting Minister of Industry and Commerce said: “Our primary agenda with them was to invite them to Afghanistan to invest there. Some companies already have interactions with Afghanistan, and for those who don’t, I am confident that this exchange will benefit both of them and their companies as they invest in Afghanistan.”\n\nMohammad Azim, the acting consul general of Afghanistan in Istanbul, stated: “Our request is for them to return to the homeland and actively contribute to the country’s development and improvement. We also ask the honorable minister to create more ease and facilities for the traders.” The acting minister further added that the Istanbul Halal Exhibition has provided a platform to market Afghanistan’s domestic products in global markets. Nooruddin Azizi said: “Turkish companies are keenly interested in contributing to Afghanistan’s development and investing in agriculture and mining sectors. They are planning a collective move to come to Afghanistan for investment.”\n\nMeanwhile, some businesspeople and economic experts believe that increasing exports to Turkey and encouraging Turkish investments in Afghanistan could significantly boost job opportunities for Afghan citizens.\n\nMahboobullah Mohammadi, a businessman, said: “Turkey is one of the key countries for exporting technology in various sectors to Afghanistan. Afghanistan, in turn, can supply essential products such as dried fruits, fresh fruits, minerals, and gemstones, which can be exported to European markets via Turkey.”\n\nSayed Masood, an economic expert, stated: “The Turks, being mediators between East and West and holding a significant economic influence, have the potential to play a major role in Afghanistan. Their economic power allows them to invest in Afghanistan with ease.”\n\nIt is worth noting that yesterday, the acting Minister of Industry and Commerce also met with Turkey’s Minister of Trade and Azerbaijan’s Deputy Minister of Economy, discussing trade development and addressing challenges in the area.",

The dollar inflows, moved under U.N. auspices, have helped stabilize the Afghan economy, cover its mammoth trade deficit, and inject monetary liquidity into commerce,” the report said.\n\n“With much smaller cash infusions, in line with a general reduction in aid, the suffering of Afghanistan’s poverty-stricken population is likely to increase,” USIP has warned.\n\nThe author of this report has suggested that, contrary to the confrontation between the countries of the world and the Islamic Emirate on the issue of women's rights, other countries and international organizations can play a supporting role in facilitating the printing of more Afghan banknotes and allow the use of investment income from the Afghanistan Fund in Switzerland to stabilize the macroeconomics.\n\nDa Afghanistan Bank (DAB) has not yet reacted to this report, but it has already emphasized that it will continue its efforts by implementing reasonable monetary policies that lead to maintaining the value of the afghani against other currencies.\n\nDAB also stressed it will pay special attention to the strength of the banking sector and bring reforms and improvements as much as possible in this sector.",

This reduction has left Afghanistan’s fragile economy in a precarious state, the report said.\n\nAccording to USIP, Afghanistan’s economy is heavily dependent on cash transactions, informal hawala systems, and the widespread use of the US dollar. “However, the country’s banking system is in disarray, plagued by international sanctions and a lack of global trust,” USIP stated.\n\nUSIP said that Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), the country’s central bank, faces significant hurdles in implementing macroeconomic policies. “Restricted access to its foreign reserves and severe limitations on printing afghani banknotes have further compounded these challenges,” the report said.\n\nWilliam Byrd, a specialist on Afghanistan at USIP, stressed the need for sound economic management to mitigate the economic fallout, saying: “Minimizing the potential economic damage will demand sound macroeconomic management by the Taliban regime. Among other measures, the country’s economic policymakers will need to organize a gradual depreciation of the excessively strong exchange rate and ensure that there are adequate amounts of afghani currency notes in circulation.”\n\nTo address these challenges, USIP proposed several key solutions:\n\nReducing reliance on the US dollar.\n\nPromoting the use of the afghani currency.\n\nEstablishing digital payment systems.\n\nThe institute also highlighted a sharp decline in humanitarian aid since 2022, which has significantly affected Afghanistan’s economy. Aid fell from $3.8 billion in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2023, with only $1.2 billion provided so far in 2024, the report said.\n\nUSIP further suggested that Afghanistan’s frozen assets in Switzerland, including nearly $400 million in investment income, could indirectly stabilize the afghani currency. The report emphasized that these funds could be utilized for macroeconomic stabilization without granting direct access to the interim government.\n\nThe comprehensive analysis underscores the urgent need for coordinated measures to stabilize Afghanistan’s economy amidst dwindling aid and persistent structural challenges.",

It said that the lack of access to Afghanistan's foreign exchange reserves and the obstacles in the way of printing banknotes add to these problems.\n\n\r\nUSIP has warned that the decrease in cash and humanitarian aid will have a destructive effect on the economy and financial system of Afghanistan.\r\n\nThe report highlights systemic challenges within Afghanistan’s banking sector, including a backlog of bad loans and limited depositor access to funds due to withdrawal restrictions imposed by Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB).\n\n“Afghanistan’s precarious economy is facing a new set of multidimensional risks as humanitarian aid — delivered in massive shipments of U.S. cash dollars — shrinks rapidly amid competing demands from other crises around the world. The dollar inflows, moved under U.N. auspices, have helped stabilize the Afghan economy, cover its mammoth trade deficit, and inject monetary liquidity into commerce,” the report said.\n\n“With much smaller cash infusions, in line with a general reduction in aid, the suffering of Afghanistan’s poverty-stricken population is likely to increase,” USIP has warned.\n\nThe author of this report has suggested that, contrary to the confrontation between the countries of the world and the Islamic Emirate on the issue of women's rights, other countries and international organizations can play a supporting role in facilitating the printing of more Afghan banknotes and allow the use of investment income from the Afghanistan Fund in Switzerland to stabilize the macroeconomics.\n\nDa Afghanistan Bank (DAB) has not yet reacted to this report, but it has already emphasized that it will continue its efforts by implementing reasonable monetary policies that lead to maintaining the value of the afghani against other currencies.\n\nDAB also stressed it will pay special attention to the strength of the banking sector and bring reforms and improvements as much as possible in this sector.",

                                    "content": "Statement by The Black Alliance for Peace (BAP)\n\nIn August 2021, following the withdrawal of major U.S./NATO military forces from Afghanistan after two decades of occupation, Taliban forces took effective control over the country. In response, the United States seized the assets of Afghanistan’s central bank totaling around $7 billion. Half of that amount was transferred to the misleadingly named “Afghan Fund” in September 2022, a Swiss-based “charitable foundation” whose only role thus far has been to privately conceal and invest the funds without any concrete plans to return them, as confirmed by U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Thomas West. This runs contrary to popular demands by experts and humanitarian organizations who argue that a return of the funds is desperately needed now more than ever to help everyday Afghans.\n\nAfghan women do not have any representation on the board of the “Afghan Fund,” nor do they have any official say over whether the assets should be returned. The board of trustees includes: two men selected by the U.S. State Department, Anwar ul-Haq Ahady and Shah Mehrabi, the U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs Jay Shambaugh, and Swiss government official Ambassador Alexandra Baumann.\n\nAccording to a July 2024 press statement from the board of the “Afghan Fund,” some of the stolen assets may also be disbursed to the Asian Development Bank, an institution controlled by the United States, Japan, and Australia via majority shareholder status. While the funds are not returning to the Afghan people, this move shows that a process to return the funds to Afghanistan can begin immediately if the board members agree to do so. Regardless of whether the funds are in fact disbursed elsewhere over time, board members Ahady, Mehrabi, Shambaugh, and Baumann are all culpable in the forced starvation and impoverishment of tens of millions of Afghans – tantamount to the collective punishment of the Afghan people.\n\nAccording to a January 2024 written testimony by the U.S. Congress-established Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), the remaining $3.5 billion in sovereign funds held in the United States may eventually be transferred to the “Afghan Fund” depending on litigation filed by the families of 9/11 victims and other plaintiffs, while other funds held in Europe and the United Arab Emirates may also be added to the “Afghan Fund.” SIGAR found that none of the funds in the “Afghan Fund” as of early 2024 have been spent, are planned to be spent, or will ever be used to provide humanitarian or development assistance. Notably, while no disbursements have been made for the benefit of the Afghan people, portions of the over $340 million in interest that have been accrued from the stolen assets are being used to pay for the “Afghan Funds” operational and administrative costs.\n\nThe sudden deprivation of access to its sovereign assets led to a sharp economic and financial crisis in Afghanistan in 2021, which a recent United Nations Development Program (UNDP) study found is disproportionately affecting women and children. The seizure of assets combined with both U.S. and UN sanctions – ostensibly only targeting the Taliban – have hurt ordinary Afghans and aid organizations, affirmed by US-aligned rights groups and media outlets. The same UNDP report found that 69% of Afghans “do not have adequate resources for basic subsistence living,” while an estimated 15.8 million Afghans – including nearly 8 million children – are expected to experience “acute food insecurity” throughout 2024.\n\nClearly, the “Afghan Fund” – controlled by Western officials and Afghan compradors – has deliberately withheld billions from the suffering Afghan populace. It should be reiterated that a process to return these stolen funds, and in turn mitigate the U.S.-enabled humanitarian and economic crises plaguing Afghanistan, can and must begin right away. The following individuals have full power or influence over the release of the illegally stolen assets back to its rightful owners: the Afghan people.\n\nJay Shambaugh\n\nUnder Secretary of the U.S. Treasury for International Affairs\n\nVisiting Associate Professor at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University\n\nFormer Consultant to the International Monetary Fund (2005, 2008, 2011-2013)\n\nFormer Director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution (2017-2020)\n\nFormer Member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors (2015-2017)\n\nFormer Chief Economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers (2009-2011)\n\nAlexandra Baumann\n\nHead of the Prosperity and Sustainability Division at the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs\n\nFormer Diplomatic Advisor of the Head of the Swiss Federal\n\nDepartment of Finance\n\nPreviously worked in the Swiss Embassies in Chile and\n\nGermany, and the Swiss Mission to the UN in New York\n\nAnwar ul-Haq Ahady\n\nFormer government official, economic advisor and central banker to the U.S./NATO occupied Afghanistan\n\nFormer Minister of Commerce and Industry (2010-2013) and Minister of Agriculture (2020-2021)\n\nFormer Minister of Finance and Advisor of National Economy to the U.S./NATO-backed President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai (2004-2009)\n\nPreviously responsible for overseeing Afghanistan’s central bank, Da Afghanistan Bank (2002-2004)\n\nShah Mehrabi\n\nMember of the Supreme Council of Da Afghanistan Bank\n\nProfessor of Economics at Montgomery College in Maryland\n\nFormer Senior Economic Advisor to previous Ministers of Finance under U.S./NATO occupied Afghanistan\n\nThomas West\n\nU.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Deputy Assistant Secretary\n\nFormer Vice President at a private global strategic advisory firm, the Cohen Group (2016-2021)\n\nFormer Special Advisor at the UN National Security Council to the U.S. Vice President for South Asia and the U.S. Director for Afghanistan and Pakistan (2012-2015)\n\nFormer U.S. State Department senior diplomat in Kunar Province, Afghanistan (2011-2012)\n\nFormer Special Assistant for South and Central Asia to the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs (2008-2010)",

PAJCCI attributes this decline to restrictive SROs 1380(I)/2023, 1397(I)/2023 issued on October 3 and SROs 1402(1)/2023 October 7, 2023, inactive banking channels, and daily operational challenges at border crossings. \n\nTogether with the IDC, these obstacles are disrupting Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan and CIS countries, as well as the broader transit trade.\n\n“This 2% CESS, combined with existing economic pressures, is creating a perfect storm that could cripple Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan, CIS countries, and reverse cargo from Afghanistan,” stated President Junaid Makda of PAJCCI. “While PAJCCI firmly supports a documented economy, these measures are inadvertently pushing trade into informal, parallel channels. This not only harms our economy but also threatens Pakistan’s standing as a regional trade leader.”\n\nThe IDC has introduced a double-taxation burden on imports routed through KPK, requiring payments at both Karachi and Peshawar, creating a competitive disadvantage for KPK-based businesses. Inconsistent Cess policies across provinces further complicate the issue, with legal challenges in KPK and potential conflicts with International Agreements Afghanistan Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA). \n\nWhile Baluchistan’s exemption of Cess on exports is a positive step, the uneven regulatory environment is diverting trade away from KPK. Afghan traders are increasingly exploring alternative routes, including through Iran, due to additional costs at Torkham.\n\nIn response, PAJCCI has engaged Prime Minister’s Office, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), and key government stakeholders, including the senior representatives from the Ministry of Commerce (MoC), Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), as well as the Chief Minister and Governor of KPK. PAJCCI has consistently advocated for uniform policies aligned with federal guidelines to ensure a fair and stable trade environment. \n\n“We urge the government to implement an immediate and comprehensive action plan to remove barriers that hinder Pakistan’s export potential and regional trade leadership,” Makda added. “This requires not only addressing the IDC but also establishing consistent policies that support transparent, sustainable trade practices across Pakistan.”\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2024",

The country is grappling with the effects of climate change, which are exacerbating existing issues. Additionally, there are concerns over the tension between Russia and Ukraine, which could have implications for Afghanistan's regional stability. The country is also seeking to strengthen its relations with China, with discussions on bilateral relations and the implementation of the Doha Agreement. Meanwhile, there are calls for the complete implementation of the Doha Agreement, which is seen as crucial for Afghanistan's peace and stability. On the economic front, China has offered Afghanistan tariff-free trade, and the private sectors of Afghanistan and Kazakhstan have signed contracts worth $100 million. However, Pakistan has banned entry to parks and zoos due to worsening air pollution, which could affect regional cooperation. In the sports sector, Afghanistan's Gurbaz has guided the team to seal an ODI series over Bangladesh, while the world is watching as Trump and Putin speak, and Biden plans to lobby Trump to stick with Ukraine.",
